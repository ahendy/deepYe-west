I used an exclamation just to be an asshole and also to make a point! LOL
And I used a period because contrary to popular belief I strongly dislike exclamation points!
On another note, I strongly dislike suit jackets. I used the word dislike because I hate the word hate.
I love you.
I have so much love in my heart and we just need the shot to create live breathe.
I love you guys.
Everyone has made mistakes. I just make them in public.
Don't hide from the truth because it is the only light.
Don't be mad at the truth. When you don't like me you are merely shooting the messenger.
Don't be scared of the truth because we need to restart the human foundation in truth
They think we're stupid. They do not know how to communicate.
When companies doubt me they doubt us.
That dreams will actualize. Dreams will manifest.
I have a dream.
Eventually the guys with real ideas not running a scam on the world will overcome.
They can't kill us all.
They can't kill us all.
I speak yell scream directly at the old guard on behalf of the future.
The Pablo pop up was almost a pop up of influence.
We are here to make life better.
And I promise the power is in the people and I will use the power given by the people to bring everything I have back to the people.
I speak truth to power!!!
I represent the dreamers.
in the past the press/old guard and powers that be would have silenced me a long time ago but I have a form of social immunity.
thank God for paps thank God for social media
We will find freedom in truth as opposed to ridicule.
We no longer have to be scared of the truth
We will breathe clean air and exercise the first amendment.
We will not get bullied by perception any longer. We will give our opinions.
We will change that. We will rise.  We will have a voice.
In Roman times the artist would contemplate proportions and colors. Now there is only one important color... Green
Let's fight for our future. We can change everything.
I stand with the utmost humility. We are so blessed!!! All praises and blessings to the families of people who never gave up on dreams
I promise I will never let the people down. I want a better life for all!!! Pablo Pablo Pablo Pablo!
This is the people the culture the dreams the future.
but there is no other brand that could sell 1 million dollars of clothing in 2 days from 1 location!!!

My whole family loves you and your family and we appreciate the moment you helped realize on the Beams!!!
I love you. My dad loves you.
Thank you Kirk for standing by me through all the noise.
The choir arrangement that Kirk orchestrated is the most powerful thing I've heard in my earthly existence.
A lot of people tell me Ultralight Beam is my greatest artwork to date only rival being Jesus Walks.
Be strong today little bro!  Come to me, all of you who are tired and have heavy loads, and I will give you rest. MATTHEW 11:28
I just received a blessing from minister Kirk Franklin
Olivier designed clothes for my show That was real,   that was groundbreaking,  that is a Real Friend.
Be real
Be real
Dont try to use me for advertisement or to make your proposed trend relevant.
If you wouldnt invite me to your house then dont invite me to your show.
Fake Fake Fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake  just my analysis
So many people turned on her when she was fired and acted like they forgot the innovation and beauty that she brought to the world
The fashion world is sooooooo fake and Carine is one of the very few real people in fashion
I like T-shirts and women in yoga pants I live in LA thats what people wear not sure why someone would put a suit jacket on with that.
All these journalists can give their opinions well these are mineyes I believe in my ripped homeless sweaters!!!
Sorry I couldnt be at Virgils show because I had a meeting in another city.
this is my friend and we've bounced ideas and references for years since the time when he designed for YEEZY Season 1.
I thank Demna for using the "I feel like Pablo" sweatshirts in his show,
I thank Olivier for designing his collection around my wife this is visionary as I believe that Kim is our modern day everything.
Oh and I only came to Paris fashion to stand by my friends Olivier, Riccardo and Demna.
Just cause somebody is wearing combat boots doesnt mean its all of a sudden youth.
I also hate all the stylists that copy Hedi Slimane and give their clients blatant YSL looks thinking that it will bring a younger client.
I feel we are so stuck in the past and tradition.
I especially hate suit jackets on women that was a groundbreaking idea 5 million years ago!
I dont personally like suit jackets anymore.
excited to see my family and finish the final mixes of the Life of Pablo and keep working on Turbo Grafx 16 and Season 4 .

I just want to thank Will Ferrell for the years of joy he has brought into my life with amazing comedy
We all know Will Ferrell has always been the one!!!
that showed how sharp and Bruce Lee status he is.
Perhaps it was seeing him play the same character from 15 years ago with 15 more years experience
His existence is a blessing.
Will Ferrell has reached walking living breathing god status!
I saw Zoolander 2 for the 2nd time
correction, the name of the Neo Geo game I was referring to was The Super Spy
We actually played Spy Hunter at my moms house!!!
My boy Mali that I spoke about on the song Drive Slow actually had a Neo Geo in real life bro
Blazing Lazers was probably my favorite game on that console 
just on some super nerd vibes one of my favorite gaming systems when I was a kid
My next album is titled"Turbo Grafx 16" as of now

Hi @Jack Dorsey, can you guys please take down all the fake Kanye accounts.
I'm not a rapper.
I just thought of the craziest idea of all ... I'm going to sell winter coats in the winter!!!
I'm going to steal Demna from Balenciaga
You won't always agree with me but I'm gon always be me. I'm woke!
The world needs a guy like me. The world needs somebody to not be scared and tell his truth.
I love being a voice of freedom when so many people are scared to speak up.
I represent what people can't say.
New album coming this summer
I'm not even gon lie to you. I love me so much right now.
And yes I've talked to Adidas and we gon hook y'all up with free Yeezys and Adidas.  All positive vibes.
That is one of the reasons I respect the paps so much.
Respect to everyone working hard to keep a roof over their kids
What is your definition of true freedom? There is no true freedom without economic freedom.
I just had to start with shoes so that I could be economically empowered enough to have a voice.
You guys will see my heart. You guys will feel my heart. We will make a difference.
It's a beautiful time.  I love my friends. I love my family.  I love people. The human race.
Free from being held back by public opinion.
I'm happy and free and proud and confident. I'm not crazy. I'm free
I'm proud as an entrepreneur that I gave everything I had to my dreams.
I'm proud as an entrepreneur that I gave everything I had to my dreams.
I wrote Saint Pablo after admitting to my greatest shame my personal debt. But I'm not ashamed anymore.
No slave mindset no more. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free.
I'm not crazy I'm free.
People ask why I speak in a public forum... Well my voice is my power. Freedom of speech. Freedom of opinion. Freedom of dreams.
We need to see Young Thug at the Grammys.  Not just me and Jay in a suit.
First order of business. We the people need to see Future at the Grammys.
and always remember that rock and roll was stolen and don't try to hide behind Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis  all positive vibes.
Us real music guys wanna have fun too
Neil please reach out as soon as possible so we can make the Grammys culturally relevant again.
All artists have a problem with it and I am going to fix it for us all starting right now.
Has anyone at the Grammys ever heard March Madness??? Yes I have a problem with the Grammys.
You like your black people a certain way also. You wouldn't have Future perform and that man owned the clubs last summer.
You guys are supposed to be all about taste.
Dexter didn't feel he even had a chance of winning and he was right!!!
Everybody with any form of taste knows that was the best video of the year!
I don't want to just fix the awards for me but I want to fix it for Dexter Navy who directed A$AP Rockys LSD video.
If I'm not at the show next year then there is no show.
Hi Grammys this is the most important living artist talking.
I feel the Grammy awarding system is way off and completely out of touch.
I feel the Grammy awarding system is way off and completely out of touch.
I don't give opinions because they are commonly agreed upon. I say what I feel.
We need to fix this.
I know so many cool artists whose hearts have been broken by the politics including mine.
I think the Grammys are super important!!!
I would like to sit down with Neil Portnow right now
I really didnt mean to use the B word tonight      all positive vibes
God bless the fools  all positive vibes!
Ezrin I truly feel sorry for your friends and family that they have had to suffer an idiot like you for so many years
Welcome to pop culture!!!
I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne in one year and wasnt nominated for either and you know who has 2 albums of the year.
Rock and Roll was stolen Rap was exploited
its guys like you that run companies and dont invest in Ye even if Im your kids idol!!!
Bob please never speak in public again you are everything that is wrong with the old guard 
Bro you said Macklemore was more important musically than me no offense to Macklemore, hes a nice human being!
Im so sorry for them   I will send them free Yeezys to make up for the embarrassment that you have caused your family!
Your kids are ashamed of their dad  Sorry for speaking about kids  but could you imagine if you were Bob Ezrins kids
Do something relevant Please dont speak on me bro ever again!!!
Im tired of old people that have no connection with anything trying to comment on music!
What the fuck does he know about rap
What the fuck does he know about rap
Has anybody ever heard of Bob Ezrin???
If you are an entrepreneur you may have debt and lawsuits #facts

Drake would come by and just help, no strings. Future also came by to write. We all got new shit together that's gonna drop soon.
I wanna thank my brother Drizzy for helping me on 30 Hours &amp; Father Stretch My Hands.
Season 4 begins. Premire Vision https://t.co/LAlvRnlUgG
My number one enemy has been my ego  there is only one throne and thats God's  
In rap we have been developing a brotherhood
There is so much positive energy right now   Lets stay on this Ultra Light Beam
A wise man should be humble enough to admit when hes wrong and change his mind based on new information
Some rappers got the club  Some got the radio some got the consciencesome got the streets Everybody has something they do the best
every rapper is somebodys favorite
that statement hast been sitting well with me Thats a dated mentality   ... Im not on that 
Man, I was thinking about when I commented on the idea of "taking the rap throne 
Just creating in a fun simple way with no politics
Imagine if the people I named went to high school 2gthr and had a project to do for school
Imagine if the people I named went to high school 2gthr and had a project to do for school
all with one purpose of creating  beautiful product that can be attainable by everyone
A dream of mine would be to do a project where I  work side by side with Raf Simmons,  Helmut Lang, Vanessa Beecroft and Martin Margiela

Hey Nicolas Ghesquiere I grew up on Tron too Lets be best friends!!!
Id rather teachers got paid more and books cost less  #2020
We have to lower the price of textbooks
Education puts Americans into debt before they even get a chance to get started
Steve Jobs wanted to lower the cost of textbooks
shes giving everything she has to make sure her son has a better future
I mean, his mom has to work 2 days just to afford 1 book for her son 
Her son just got in a really good school and his textbooks are like $400 dollars each 
I have a friend who works really hard and makes $370 dollars a day
All positive energy
so many people were inspired  and thats all I wanted
MSG was amazing 
You let me dream without limits.
They provided resources for me to create they supported me   I thank you so so much  
Adidas has really made all the difference 
Thank you Adidas  for supporting my creative vision 
Thank you Adidas  for supporting my creative vision 
Pablo is full of joy and love because I was able to create.
I hope these words and this moment of truth can serve as some extra motivation to you
for anybody listening to Pablo now, working on a dream
so people laughed when I said I wanted to be able to take care of my family 
but if you dont have your paper right, there's a chance that your family can be broken up
when Sway was telling me what to do, I was in debt, and had a child
When Charlemagne was calling me "donkey of the day" I was in debt
I can see the clouds separating 
Im  an artist  the definition of art - or at least my definition - is to be able to see the truth and then express it...
I dont have to be cool
perhaps a fashion group will cover the 53 that Ive invested over the past 13 years
Perhaps Adidas will do some big Lebron style deal or  
my dreams brought me into debt and Im close to seeing the light of day
this country was built off of dreamers    never give up on your dreams, bro
You can point fingers and laugh, but for all entrepreneurs with families  ...
I wanted the world to know my struggle
Money doesnt make me who I am
You cant control me or use the debt against me no more   
For the past 3 years people who knew about the debt tried to use it against me in negotiations 
For the past 3 years people who knew about the debt tried to use it against me in negotiations 
only problem I got with Good Fridays is I got more songs than I got old pictures!!!! Lol!!!!
Also all Good Fridays songs will be on Tidal. Me and Kendrick got 40 songs and me and Young Thug got 40 songs. 40/40 club!!!
Please to all my friends fans and music lovers. Sign up to Tidal now.
My album will never never never be on Apple. And it will never be for sale... You can only get it on Tidal.
This was made with love. Only God can judge me. So I only expect love back!!!
Shut the fuck up and enjoy the greatness.
Aight then 
Don't tell me Lebron had a bad game. What yo jump shot look like???
The system is designed for colored people to fail and one of our only voices is music. One of our only ways out is music.
I love love love white people but you don't understand what it means to be the great grandson of ex slaves and make it this far.
To Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, New York Times, and any other white publication. Please do not comment on black music anymore.
Puff Daddy is the most important cultural figure in my life. His influence means everything to me.
Pitchfork, the album is a 30 out of 10
People wanted me to tweet again well here's some tweets!!!
and a balance art family perception friends family politics and the fucking manipulators
No matter what level you're at in life there is still a struggle
but if the self proclaimed cockiest person in the world can lay his personal business on the line then please people see my heart.
This is a God dream
I know I confuse you guys sometimes but please bare with me.
I know I confuse you guys sometimes but please bare with me.
I am ultra light beaming right now. So many people have called or emailed to help today hedge fund guys billionaires etc...
I am of service to the world with my art and I just want to serve more.
and I think the idea of being a celebrity a lot of times blocks the understanding of what my purpose is.
There are people who support artist and philanthropist
I could not have done the MSG without Adidas but world, what I'm telling you is that was just a small sketch for what I will bring you.
Also for anyone that has money they know the first rule is to use other people's money.
If I spent my money on my ideas I could not afford to take care of my family. I am in a place that so many artist end up.
but I need access to more money in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world.
Yes I am personally rich and I can buy furs and houses for my family
I want to help the world and I need help to do it. I am an artist and I care about humanity.
I just feel rich people are always too cool to ask for help trying to impress each other at dinner parties.
...on another note, can brah be the girl verson of bruh???
and yes there are misspellings on this chart thats how you know its me...
All you guys had meetings with me and no one lifted a finger to help.
I promise Im going to make the world dope. all I do is make shit dope #facts
if you want to help help me
youd rather open up one school in Africa like you really helped the country
All you dudes in San Fran play rap music in your homes    but never help the real artists
hey Larry Page Im down for your help too 
hey Larry Page Im down for your help too 
Here is my Donda chart that I wrote 4 years ago that everyone laughed at https://t.co/g1po6Z3H55
I know I can make the world a better place I have done the impossible  I retook the throne of rap I beat the fashion game
and I will always respect you for that and the world will love you
one of the coolest things you could ever do is to help me in my time of need
Mark, I am publicly asking you for help
I dont have enough resources to create what I really can
Im this generation's Disney I want to bring dope shit to the world
World, please tweet, FaceTime, Facebook, instagram, whatever you gotta do to get Mark to support me
You love hip hop, you love my art I am your favorite artist but you watch me barely breathe and still play my album in your house 
Mark Zuckerberg  I know its your bday but can you please call me by 2mrw
I put Lowlights on my album just thinking about all the moms driving they kids to school then going to work
Bars are worth more than money because it's something the people can use everyday to feel inspired.
I know y'all tired of music controlled by money and perception.  I'm proud of every dime of debt I got.
All y'all so worried about being likable but only a few are concerned about being great!!!
I am the Jordan and Steph Curry of music, meaning I'm the best of 2 generations.
I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne in one year and wasn't nominated for either ... I will have over 100 Grammys before I die.

Let's dance in the streets. I am consumed by my purpose to help the world.
All memes are wrong... The Life of Paul... The life of Pablo... Ultralight beams... Moms dads daughters sons stand up...
Please forgive the profanity and give hugs and blessings to my brother Kirk for standing by me... In a few hours the journey begins...
He was saved from persecution due to his Roman citizenship... I have the right to speak my voice...
He was a learned man not of the original sect so he was able to take the message to the rest of the world...
Paul ... The most powerful messenger of the first century... Now we stand here 20 centuries later... Because he was a traveler...

Ive given everything I had for this moment a lot of people feel its the paradigm shift 
fashion aint no joke for me Its a way of life creative expression and industry
so many people didnt make it and gave everything they had for me to stand on their shoulders and break through fashion
Your site is entertaining and hilarious but certain things are just too far you have no idea what Ive had to go through 
Im a human being Im an artist, bro
you probably got bootleg Yeezys on right now
but Media Takeout couldnt say one thing positive knowing damn well youd love to be on the YEEZY 350 list
people were crying people were throwing up the fist people were dancing
I had an album listening and clothing presentation and Madison Square Garden
respect the struggle respect the hustle respect the dreams  respect the movement
You seem like the type of organization hired to always keep dreamers down when certain things in history happen you just got to respect it
Now - Media Takeout - always remember that you dissed the collection that changed the world.
Its Chance's fault the album not out yet he really wanted Waves on that Bitch  we in the lab now...
There would be no MSG without @iamdiddy my OG. He fought this war 15 years ago. Respect OG.

I want to be the creative director of Hermes
not just the famous people there    but the kids   the moms the dads  the families that came to share this moment with us
9th   It felt like a seen from The Warriors     ALL GODS   ALL GODS ALL GODS in the buildin
but you can see at Madison Square Garden that you can stop us
8th   They want to control us with money and perception and mute the culture
7th  I miss that feeling  so thats what I want to help restore
Thats why music is so fucking watered down right now    I miss that DMX feeling
6th  Stop trying to demonize real artist     Stop trying to compromise art
I cant be mad at Kanye because he made me famous!  #FACTS
She was having dinner with one of our friends whos name I will keep out of this and she told him
5th  thing Im not even gone take credit for the idea its actually something Taylor came up with 
4th Bitch is an endearing term in hip hop  like the word Nigga
3rd thing    I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings
2nd thing   I asked my wife  for her blessings and she was cool with it
First thing is Im an artist and as an artist I will express how I feel with no censorship
First thing is Im an artist and as an artist I will express how I feel with no censorship
I did not diss Taylor Swift and Ive never dissed her

Seems like just yesterday we were interning at Fendi - now youre nominated for the LVMH Young Designer Prize.
I am so proud of my family Virgil Abloh.
If you wanna have a drink with me, book a table at the spotted pig when Im back in NY.
We want to innovate and we will win someday.
All we have are our dreams, and you can step on our dreams and ideas all you want, but we wont stop fighting.
Fame is often looked down upon in the design world, so its actually been something I had to overcome.
because I was too famous by the time I realized I wanted to design.
I dont call myself a designer as I was not allowed to go to Saint Martins
I have millions of ideas and I represent a new generation just trying to express themselves in a broken world.
and I have encountered countless amounts of bigotry along the way.
To Fern Mallis: I just want you to understand that attempting to do clothing has been very difficult

The doors may be heavier, but I promise you WE WILL BREAK THEM.
Ten years later I am still the same kid from Chicago, still dreaming out loud, still banging on the door.
I wake up every day trying to give something back to you that you can rock to and be proud of.
I am honored and humbled by my fans, for the unwavering support and love over the past ten years.
gave of their heart to that project, and to all the projects that followed, and are to come.
I am extremely grateful to each and every person along that road who helped, lent an ear, lent their voice,
to not only convince my peers and the public that I could be an artist, but to actually get that art out for the world to hear.
I say "finally" because it was a long road, a constant struggle, and a true labor of love
Ten years ago today we finally released what had been my life's work up to that point: The College Dropout.

Thank you, Mandela, for your life's work and may it serve as a guiding light to illuminate our future.
At a young age my mother taught me the importance of his work. Mandela sacrificed his life for the betterment of mankind.
I'd like to address the false stories and noise that have been engineered by the media.
Despite recent media reports, I've never said anything to dishonor or trivialize the life or transition of one of the most inspiring leaders
Respect to Mandela, his family and his legacy.

And to who ever leaked the video     FUK YOU!
Allow me and Nick to give the world what we've been losing sleep over.
So any website that may have the unapproved / unfinished ruff. I ask you to please take it down.
The final version will be ready within the next week.
Me and Nick Knight have been working on this video for 5 months and for creatives it's heartbreaking when something like this happens.
The BLKKK SKKKN HD video that leaked yesterday was not the official version.
Thank you Jean Touitou for letting me create with you http://t.co/ctery9mHJA
