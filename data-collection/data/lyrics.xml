What in da fuck was dat Kanye?I told you to do some shit for da kids.
You give me your muthafucking graduation ticket right now.
You can give me this muthafuckin robe
You will not walk across that stage, you won't slide across that stage
A muthafucka can't pull you across that mothafuckin stage Kanye
Who told you see, I told you to do something up lifting
I'm trynna get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me
You know what us a nigga
And I don't mean that in no nice way
Had little kids singin about the shit, the jokes on you
You can throw your muthafuckin hands in the air, and wave good-bye to every-mothafuckin-body
Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus
Motha what you gone do now

I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody.
I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody.
I got something better than school but don't tell anybody.
My momma would kill me so don't tell anybody.
She wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody.
She ain't walked in my shoes, I'm just not everybody.
