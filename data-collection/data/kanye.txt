I used an exclamation just to be an asshole and also to make a point! LOL
And I used a period because contrary to popular belief I strongly dislike exclamation points!
On another note, I strongly dislike suit jackets. I used the word dislike because I hate the word hate.
I love you.
I have so much love in my heart and we just need the shot to create live breathe.
I love you guys.
Everyone has made mistakes. I just make them in public.
Don't hide from the truth because it is the only light.
Don't be mad at the truth. When you don't like me you are merely shooting the messenger.
Don't be scared of the truth because we need to restart the human foundation in truth
They think we're stupid. They do not know how to communicate.
When companies doubt me they doubt us.
That dreams will actualize. Dreams will manifest.
I have a dream.
Eventually the guys with real ideas not running a scam on the world will overcome.
They can't kill us all.
They can't kill us all.
I speak yell scream directly at the old guard on behalf of the future.
The Pablo pop up was almost a pop up of influence.
We are here to make life better.
And I promise the power is in the people and I will use the power given by the people to bring everything I have back to the people.
I speak truth to power!!!
I represent the dreamers.
in the past the press/old guard and powers that be would have silenced me a long time ago but I have a form of social immunity.
thank God for paps thank God for social media
We will find freedom in truth as opposed to ridicule.
We no longer have to be scared of the truth
We will breathe clean air and exercise the first amendment.
We will not get bullied by perception any longer. We will give our opinions.
We will change that. We will rise.  We will have a voice.
In Roman times the artist would contemplate proportions and colors. Now there is only one important color... Green
Let's fight for our future. We can change everything.
I stand with the utmost humility. We are so blessed!!! All praises and blessings to the families of people who never gave up on dreams
I promise I will never let the people down. I want a better life for all!!! Pablo Pablo Pablo Pablo!
This is the people the culture the dreams the future.
but there is no other brand that could sell 1 million dollars of clothing in 2 days from 1 location!!!

My whole family loves you and your family and we appreciate the moment you helped realize on the Beams!!!
I love you. My dad loves you.
Thank you Kirk for standing by me through all the noise.
The choir arrangement that Kirk orchestrated is the most powerful thing I've heard in my earthly existence.
A lot of people tell me Ultralight Beam is my greatest artwork to date only rival being Jesus Walks.
Be strong today little bro!  Come to me, all of you who are tired and have heavy loads, and I will give you rest. MATTHEW 11:28
I just received a blessing from minister Kirk Franklin
Olivier designed clothes for my show That was real,   that was groundbreaking,  that is a Real Friend.
Be real
Be real
Dont try to use me for advertisement or to make your proposed trend relevant.
If you wouldnt invite me to your house then dont invite me to your show.
Fake Fake Fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake  just my analysis
So many people turned on her when she was fired and acted like they forgot the innovation and beauty that she brought to the world
The fashion world is sooooooo fake and Carine is one of the very few real people in fashion
I like T-shirts and women in yoga pants I live in LA thats what people wear not sure why someone would put a suit jacket on with that.
All these journalists can give their opinions well these are mineyes I believe in my ripped homeless sweaters!!!
Sorry I couldnt be at Virgils show because I had a meeting in another city.
this is my friend and we've bounced ideas and references for years since the time when he designed for YEEZY Season 1.
I thank Demna for using the "I feel like Pablo" sweatshirts in his show,
I thank Olivier for designing his collection around my wife this is visionary as I believe that Kim is our modern day everything.
Oh and I only came to Paris fashion to stand by my friends Olivier, Riccardo and Demna.
Just cause somebody is wearing combat boots doesnt mean its all of a sudden youth.
I also hate all the stylists that copy Hedi Slimane and give their clients blatant YSL looks thinking that it will bring a younger client.
I feel we are so stuck in the past and tradition.
I especially hate suit jackets on women that was a groundbreaking idea 5 million years ago!
I dont personally like suit jackets anymore.
excited to see my family and finish the final mixes of the Life of Pablo and keep working on Turbo Grafx 16 and Season 4 .

I just want to thank Will Ferrell for the years of joy he has brought into my life with amazing comedy
We all know Will Ferrell has always been the one!!!
that showed how sharp and Bruce Lee status he is.
Perhaps it was seeing him play the same character from 15 years ago with 15 more years experience
His existence is a blessing.
Will Ferrell has reached walking living breathing god status!
I saw Zoolander 2 for the 2nd time
correction, the name of the Neo Geo game I was referring to was The Super Spy
We actually played Spy Hunter at my moms house!!!
My boy Mali that I spoke about on the song Drive Slow actually had a Neo Geo in real life bro
Blazing Lazers was probably my favorite game on that console 
just on some super nerd vibes one of my favorite gaming systems when I was a kid
My next album is titled"Turbo Grafx 16" as of now

Hi @Jack Dorsey, can you guys please take down all the fake Kanye accounts.
I'm not a rapper.
I just thought of the craziest idea of all ... I'm going to sell winter coats in the winter!!!
I'm going to steal Demna from Balenciaga
You won't always agree with me but I'm gon always be me. I'm woke!
The world needs a guy like me. The world needs somebody to not be scared and tell his truth.
I love being a voice of freedom when so many people are scared to speak up.
I represent what people can't say.
New album coming this summer
I'm not even gon lie to you. I love me so much right now.
And yes I've talked to Adidas and we gon hook y'all up with free Yeezys and Adidas.  All positive vibes.
That is one of the reasons I respect the paps so much.
Respect to everyone working hard to keep a roof over their kids
What is your definition of true freedom? There is no true freedom without economic freedom.
I just had to start with shoes so that I could be economically empowered enough to have a voice.
You guys will see my heart. You guys will feel my heart. We will make a difference.
It's a beautiful time.  I love my friends. I love my family.  I love people. The human race.
Free from being held back by public opinion.
I'm happy and free and proud and confident. I'm not crazy. I'm free
I'm proud as an entrepreneur that I gave everything I had to my dreams.
I'm proud as an entrepreneur that I gave everything I had to my dreams.
I wrote Saint Pablo after admitting to my greatest shame my personal debt. But I'm not ashamed anymore.
No slave mindset no more. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free.
I'm not crazy I'm free.
People ask why I speak in a public forum... Well my voice is my power. Freedom of speech. Freedom of opinion. Freedom of dreams.
We need to see Young Thug at the Grammys.  Not just me and Jay in a suit.
First order of business. We the people need to see Future at the Grammys.
and always remember that rock and roll was stolen and don't try to hide behind Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis  all positive vibes.
Us real music guys wanna have fun too
Neil please reach out as soon as possible so we can make the Grammys culturally relevant again.
All artists have a problem with it and I am going to fix it for us all starting right now.
Has anyone at the Grammys ever heard March Madness??? Yes I have a problem with the Grammys.
You like your black people a certain way also. You wouldn't have Future perform and that man owned the clubs last summer.
You guys are supposed to be all about taste.
Dexter didn't feel he even had a chance of winning and he was right!!!
Everybody with any form of taste knows that was the best video of the year!
I don't want to just fix the awards for me but I want to fix it for Dexter Navy who directed A$AP Rockys LSD video.
If I'm not at the show next year then there is no show.
Hi Grammys this is the most important living artist talking.
I feel the Grammy awarding system is way off and completely out of touch.
I feel the Grammy awarding system is way off and completely out of touch.
I don't give opinions because they are commonly agreed upon. I say what I feel.
We need to fix this.
I know so many cool artists whose hearts have been broken by the politics including mine.
I think the Grammys are super important!!!
I would like to sit down with Neil Portnow right now
I really didnt mean to use the B word tonight      all positive vibes
God bless the fools  all positive vibes!
Ezrin I truly feel sorry for your friends and family that they have had to suffer an idiot like you for so many years
Welcome to pop culture!!!
I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne in one year and wasnt nominated for either and you know who has 2 albums of the year.
Rock and Roll was stolen Rap was exploited
its guys like you that run companies and dont invest in Ye even if Im your kids idol!!!
Bob please never speak in public again you are everything that is wrong with the old guard 
Bro you said Macklemore was more important musically than me no offense to Macklemore, hes a nice human being!
Im so sorry for them   I will send them free Yeezys to make up for the embarrassment that you have caused your family!
Your kids are ashamed of their dad  Sorry for speaking about kids  but could you imagine if you were Bob Ezrins kids
Do something relevant Please dont speak on me bro ever again!!!
Im tired of old people that have no connection with anything trying to comment on music!
What the fuck does he know about rap

My number one enemy has been my ego  there is only one throne and thats God's  
In rap we have been developing a brotherhood
There is so much positive energy right now   Lets stay on this Ultra Light Beam
A wise man should be humble enough to admit when hes wrong and change his mind based on new information
Some rappers got the club  Some got the radio some got the consciencesome got the streets Everybody has something they do the best
every rapper is somebodys favorite
that statement hast been sitting well with me Thats a dated mentality   ... Im not on that 
Man, I was thinking about when I commented on the idea of "taking the rap throne 
Just creating in a fun simple way with no politics
Imagine if the people I named went to high school 2gthr and had a project to do for school
Imagine if the people I named went to high school 2gthr and had a project to do for school
all with one purpose of creating  beautiful product that can be attainable by everyone
A dream of mine would be to do a project where I  work side by side with Raf Simmons,  Helmut Lang, Vanessa Beecroft and Martin Margiela

Hey Nicolas Ghesquiere I grew up on Tron too Lets be best friends!!!
Id rather teachers got paid more and books cost less  #2020
We have to lower the price of textbooks
Education puts Americans into debt before they even get a chance to get started
Steve Jobs wanted to lower the cost of textbooks
shes giving everything she has to make sure her son has a better future
I mean, his mom has to work 2 days just to afford 1 book for her son 
Her son just got in a really good school and his textbooks are like $400 dollars each 
I have a friend who works really hard and makes $370 dollars a day
All positive energy
so many people were inspired  and thats all I wanted
MSG was amazing 
You let me dream without limits.
They provided resources for me to create they supported me   I thank you so so much  
Adidas has really made all the difference 
Thank you Adidas  for supporting my creative vision 
Thank you Adidas  for supporting my creative vision 
Pablo is full of joy and love because I was able to create.
I hope these words and this moment of truth can serve as some extra motivation to you
for anybody listening to Pablo now, working on a dream
so people laughed when I said I wanted to be able to take care of my family 
but if you dont have your paper right, there's a chance that your family can be broken up
when Sway was telling me what to do, I was in debt, and had a child
When Charlemagne was calling me "donkey of the day" I was in debt
I can see the clouds separating 
Im  an artist  the definition of art - or at least my definition - is to be able to see the truth and then express it...
I dont have to be cool
perhaps a fashion group will cover the 53 that Ive invested over the past 13 years
Perhaps Adidas will do some big Lebron style deal or  
my dreams brought me into debt and Im close to seeing the light of day
this country was built off of dreamers    never give up on your dreams, bro
You can point fingers and laugh, but for all entrepreneurs with families  ...
I wanted the world to know my struggle
Money doesnt make me who I am
You cant control me or use the debt against me no more   
For the past 3 years people who knew about the debt tried to use it against me in negotiations

Don't tell me Lebron had a bad game. What yo jump shot look like???
The system is designed for colored people to fail and one of our only voices is music. One of our only ways out is music.
I love love love white people but you don't understand what it means to be the great grandson of ex slaves and make it this far.
To Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, New York Times, and any other white publication. Please do not comment on black music anymore.
Puff Daddy is the most important cultural figure in my life. His influence means everything to me.
Pitchfork, the album is a 30 out of 10
People wanted me to tweet again well here's some tweets!!!
and a balance art family perception friends family politics and the fucking manipulators
No matter what level you're at in life there is still a struggle
but if the self proclaimed cockiest person in the world can lay his personal business on the line then please people see my heart.
This is a God dream
I know I confuse you guys sometimes but please bare with me.
I know I confuse you guys sometimes but please bare with me.
I am ultra light beaming right now. So many people have called or emailed to help today hedge fund guys billionaires etc...
I am of service to the world with my art and I just want to serve more.
and I think the idea of being a celebrity a lot of times blocks the understanding of what my purpose is.
There are people who support artist and philanthropist
I could not have done the MSG without Adidas but world, what I'm telling you is that was just a small sketch for what I will bring you.
Also for anyone that has money they know the first rule is to use other people's money.
If I spent my money on my ideas I could not afford to take care of my family. I am in a place that so many artist end up.
but I need access to more money in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world.
Yes I am personally rich and I can buy furs and houses for my family
I want to help the world and I need help to do it. I am an artist and I care about humanity.
I just feel rich people are always too cool to ask for help trying to impress each other at dinner parties.
...on another note, can brah be the girl verson of bruh???
and yes there are misspellings on this chart thats how you know its me...
All you guys had meetings with me and no one lifted a finger to help.
I promise Im going to make the world dope. all I do is make shit dope #facts
if you want to help help me
youd rather open up one school in Africa like you really helped the country
All you dudes in San Fran play rap music in your homes    but never help the real artists
hey Larry Page Im down for your help too
