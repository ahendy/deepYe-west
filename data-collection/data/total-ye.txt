What in da fuck was dat Kanye?I told you to do some shit for da kids.
You give me your muthafucking graduation ticket right now.
You can give me this muthafuckin robe
You will not walk across that stage, you won't slide across that stage
A muthafucka can't pull you across that mothafuckin stage Kanye
Who told you see, I told you to do something up lifting
I'm trynna get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me
You know what us a nigga
And I don't mean that in no nice way
Had little kids singin about the shit, the jokes on you
You can throw your muthafuckin hands in the air, and wave good-bye to every-mothafuckin-body
Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus
Motha what you gone do now

I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody.
I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody.
I got something better than school but don't tell anybody.
My momma would kill me so don't tell anybody.
She wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody.
She ain't walked in my shoes, I'm just not everybody
I always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
Wow, one day, they tried to bring me down
ALways knew that one day, they would try to bring me down
Down, way down

We gon' to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you evern wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin, that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some lee way on the he say she say
You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say No able ingle
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't hurt myself
Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself
And I'm a look in the mirror if I need some help
Ask me from the heart, y'all all frontin
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel somethin

Why you come here, I bet it only it was forget to get you
What kind of dream we found, see I'm often at your cross way
forgetting it was that heaven let you. They tried to bring me down
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

She don?t believe in shootin' stars,
but she believe in shoes & cars
Wood floors in the new apartment,
couture from the store?s department
You more like "I love to start shit",
I?m more of the, trips to florida
Order the hors d'oeuvre, views of the Water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy,
man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy,
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a ?Oeur de Whopdee?
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggaz got me,
I hate these niggaz more than the Nazis

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

I know it?s been a while,
Sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay,
a-bay late-ly you been all on my brain,
And if somebody would?ve told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn?t wanna know
If somebody would?ve told me a year ago
it'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory?s museum,
I?m just saying, Hey Mona Lisa,
come home you know you can?t Rome without Caesar

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights

Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

Lights, lights, lights, lights?It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing

I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved

And no matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing

I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave in, never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing

Standing at my podium, I'm trying to watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure either let the feds catch ya (yeah)
I'm amazing born on a full moon
I was breed to get it in, no spoon
That's why I'm so goon summer time no joke
Big family small house, no room
They like "Oh God, why he go so hard
Look what he's been through, he deserves an applause"

So amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing
Stadium Status...

Uh...

My big brother was BIG's brother,
Used to Be Dame and BIG's brother,
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend,
No I.D my mentor, Now Let the story begin.

It's the hard knock life tour, sell out,
Picture us in the mall coppin' iceberg and yell out jigga (jigga),
Yeah that's what we'll yell out (yell out),
You know the name do, i gotta spell out, or tell bout?

J.A.Y, and Ye' so shy, now he won't even step to his idol to say hi.
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by,
Back of my mind, he could change your life.
With all these beats i did, atleast let him hear,
Atleast you can brag to your friends back at the gig.

But he got me out my mama' crib,
Then he helped me get my mama' a crib.

Big brother was BIG's brother,
Used to Be Dame and BIG's brother,
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend,
No I.D my mentor, Now Let the story begin (begin).

Let the story begin (let the story begin).
If you feel the way i feel, why don't you wave your hands?

Fresh off the plane, im off the base line.
Nothin' handed out, im bout to take mine.
Round the same time of that Blueprint One,
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for im'.
I played my little songs in that old back room,
He'd bop his head and say, 'damn, oh thats you?'
But by the black album, i was blackin' out,
Party at S.O.B's and we had packed the crowd.

Big brother got a show up in Madison Square,
And i'm like, 'Yeah yeah, we gon' be there!'
But, not only did i not get a chance to spit it.
Carlene told me i could buy two tickets.

I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different,
And kept little brother at bay at a distance.
But everything that i felt was more bogus,
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent.

Only thing i wanna know, is why i get looked over,
I guess i understand when i get more older.
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem,
Now im' on the top and everybody on the Scrotum.

My Big brother was B.I.G's brother,
Used to Be Dame and B.I.G's brother,
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend,
No I.D my mentor, now Let the story begin (begin).

Let the story begin.
If you feel the way i feel, why won't you wave your hands?

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, but the presedito.
Hola' Hovito', the game gettin' foul, so here's a free throw.
I was always on the other side of the people,
Then i dropped Jesus Walks, now im on a steeple.
And we know, New Jack City gotta keep my brother,
But to be number one, imma' beat my brother.

On that diamonds remix, i swore i'd spaz,
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass!
Sibling rivalry, only i could see, it was the pride in me, that was drivin' me.
At the grammy's i said, i inspired me.
But my big brother who i always tried to be.
When i kicked the flow, it was like pick and roll',
Coz even if he gave me the ROC, it's give and go.

I guess Beanie styled was more of a slam dunk,
And my shit was more like a finger roll, but i had them singles so,
And them hoe's at the show gonna' mingle yo, (laughs), ya'll know!

I told Jay i did a song with Coldplay,
Next thing i know, he got a song with Coldplay.
Back of my mind, im like 'damn,no way',
Translate Espanyol, No way Jose'!
Then i went and told Jay Brown,
Should have known that was gonna come back around,
Should have talked to you like a man, should have told you first,
But i told someone else and thats what made shit worse.

My big brother, was BIG's brother,
So here's a few words from ya kid brother.
If you admire somebody, you should go head and tell em',
People never get the flowers, while they can still smell em'.

A idol in my eyes, god of the game, heart of the city, Roc-a-fella Chain,
Never be the same, never be another number one Young Hov' or so my big brother.

My Big brother was B.I.G's brother,
Used to Be Dame and B.I.G's brother,
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend,
No I.D my mentor, and thats where the story ends..

What Gil Scott was hearin
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin.
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland
We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynch
And we been hangin from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it,sell it
The fiends cop it
Nowadays they cant tell if that's that good shit
We ain't sure man
Put the CD on your toungue yeah, thats pure man.


From the place where the fathers gone,
The mothers is hardly home
And the...
Gonna lock us up in a...home
How the Mexicans say we just tryin to party homes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical,
Arm and Hammer baking soda
Raised they own quota
Writin when our soldiers ran for the stove cuz--
Cuz dreams of being 'Hova went from bein a brokeman ta bein a dopeman
Ta bein a president look theres hope man
This that inspiration for tha mos and tha folks man,
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosin.

Our father, give us this day our daily bread ...give us these days and take our daily bread,
See I done did all this ole bullshit
And to attone I throw a little somethin, somethin on the pulpit.
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mammas aint got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from grammy
Now the former slaves trade hooks for grammies
This dark dixon has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use it.Time is wandering fast over the hills and alleys
Time is wandering fast over the streets and valleys
Time is wandering fast I wonder how far is will go
Time is wandering fast children are running to gather her
Time is wandering fast all of the seasons are passing her
Time is wandering fast I wonder how far is will go
TIme is wandering fastI had a dream I can buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace.
I told God I'd be back in a second,
Man It's so hard not to act reckless.
To whom much is given much is tested.
Get arrested, guess until, they get the message.
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny,
and what I do? act more stupidly.
bought more jewelry, more louis v, my mama couldn't get through to me.
The drama, people suing me,
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me.
I'm just saying how I feel man,
I ain't one of the Cosby?s I ain?t go to Hill man
I guess the money should've changed him,
I guess I should've forgot where I came From.

La, la, la, la wait till I get my money right
la, la, la, la then you cant tell me nothing right
Excuse Me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let up the suicide doors.
This is my life homey, you decide yours.
I know that Jesus died for us,
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars.
So I parallel double parked that muthafucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homey this is my day.
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
You know I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it.

They say I talk with so much emphasis,
They're so sensative.
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
Say something were you gone end up apologing.
Let me know if it's a problem man,
Alright man, holla then.

Chorus:
La, la, la, la wait till I get my money right
la, la, la, la then you can't tell me nothing right
Excuse Me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash,
Let that man get past.
You don't need a stop to get gas,
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off the fumes cuzz
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul,
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold.
Treasure. What's you pleasure?
Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her.
So if the devil wear Prada,
Adam Eve wear Nada,
I'm in between, but way more fresher.
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard,
That's when you die hard.
Ya homies looking like "Why God?"
When they reminisce over you, my god.

Chorus:
La, la, la, la wait till I get my money right
la, la, la, la then you cant tell me nothing right
Excuse Me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing.''Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin' show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
That's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

''Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But everytime I want it, layaway or a deposit
My daddy say "when you see clothes close your eyelids"
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'll get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he sent me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey!

''Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib

''Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

When it feel like livin's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'

'Cause who the kids gon' listen to? Huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the drop out keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems
Like I dropped out of P.E.
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

Desert me

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
he write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If you're a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more could you ask for?
The international assholes nah
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&amp;amp;R's lookin' like &amp;quot;pssh we messed up&amp;quot;
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog &amp;quot;Yo, where Dame at?&amp;quot;
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
&amp;quot;What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?&amp;quot;
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)Oh oh ohoo.
damn, here we go again.
Oh oh ohoo.
Common passed on this beat, i made it to a jam,

now everything im not, made me everything i am.
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything im not, made me everything i am.

I never be picture-perfect
Be light as Al B. or black as Chauncey
Remember him from
He was as black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as his beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
Y'see how I creeped up?
Y'see how I played a big role in Chicago like?
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
but everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

and i'm back to tear it up
haters, start your engines
I hear 'em gearin' up
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops
they forget to get they haircut
okay fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
so say goodbye to the NAACP award
goodbye to the In-di-a Arie award
they'd rather give me the ni-nigga-please award
but I'll just take the I-got-alotta-cheese award

damn, here we go again.
but everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

I know people wouldn't usually rap this
but I got the facts to back this
just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
man, killin's some wack shit
oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
he got changed over his chains, a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
the church want tithes, so I can't afford to pay
the slip on my door, cause I can't afford to stay
my 15 seconds' up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today

damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
but everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I amFlashing lights, lights

She don?t believe in shootin' stars,
but she believe in shoes & cars
Wood floors in the new apartment,
couture from the store?s department
You more like "I love to start shit",
I?m more of the, trips to florida
Order the hors d'oeuvre, views of the Water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy,
man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy,
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a ?Oeur de Whopdee?
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggaz got me,
I hate these niggaz more than the Nazis

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

I know it?s been a while,
Sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay,

And if somebody would?ve told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn?t wanna know
If somebody would?ve told me a year ago

Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory?s museum,
I?m just saying, Hey Mona Lisa,

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? Flashing lights, lights

Cutie the bomb met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you rock I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock I can tell by your charm

My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
An I gotta take all they bad ass to show-biz
Ok, get your kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to Den and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be payed
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she use to fuck wit Usher
I dont care what none of yall say, I still love her


18 years, 18 years
She got one of yo kids got you for 18 years
I know somebody payin child support for one of his kids
His baby momma car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was s'pose to buy you shorty TYCO with your money
She went to the doctor got lypo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should of got that insured GEICO for your money
If you aint no punk
holla 'We Want Prenup' 'WE WANT PRENUP! Yeaah!'
It's something that you need to have
Cause when she leave your ass she gone leave with half
18 years, 18 years
And on her 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his


Now I ain't sayin you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You got out to eat and he can't pay, ya'll cant leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But why ya'll washin' watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look in his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know his dude's ballin, but yeah thats nice
And they gone keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right girl
And when you get on, he leave your ass for a white girl

See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
BROTHER NUMPSAY! Groupies sound too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way

Too late, we, gone - we strivin home
Gone - we ride on chrome
It's too late

Y'all don't want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the win-turr
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught somethin on the Usher tour he had to &quot;Let it Burn&quot;
Plus he already got three chil'run
Arguin over babysitters like, &quot;Bitch - it's yo' turn!&quot;
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to bitch you
Even your superficial raps is super official
R-R-R-Roc pastel with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long
Cause the dookie's on any song that they threw me on, gone

We strivin home, gone I ride on chrome...
We strivin home, gone Killa, I ride on chrome

Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?

No concealin, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof, be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag, niggas still doin puff puff pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em

Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm (gone)
My last girl want me back then I'm on

Came back, read what the sign say (too late, he, gone)
Yes I know you wanna see my demise

Ain't leavin my side, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi, shit
And that ain't leavin alive, please believe me
Gave Weezy a piece of the pie, and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole Westside I explore with the Beemer now

We strivin home, I ride on chrome
Listen homeboy move on
That's your best bet, why's that?
Cause

Uhh, uhh, yo, yo
I been pourin out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And tryin to help his momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got a foul on, what coulda gone wrong
Now they askin Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money mighta gone to my head
Cause they got me thinkin money mighta gone to the feds
So I ain't goin to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed
And when I came the next mornin he was gone with my bread
And with that bein said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But lookin back now shoulda gone to the crib
And rented &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; cause I'da gone about 10
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is tellin me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for 20 years, doin time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some cruddy crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone


Uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh I'mmmm
Ah-head of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my Aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leavin it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime-
-light, like, when I was on the grind
In the "One, Nine, Nine, Nine"
Before, model chicks was bendin over or
Dealerships asked me Benz or Rover, man
If I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an 18-year-old
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro
My dawg worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural-fied
A week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirrow
How we out in Europe, spendin Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's GONE
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MC's
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything includin the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin, stay calm
Shorty's at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said sorry Mr. West is gone!Like we always do at this time

Whipped it out, she said "I never seen snakes on a plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get izz
Having money's the everything that having' it is
I was splurging' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas cause
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life

Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmama ain't the only girl calling me baby

Whooooooooooo, what up derrty?
Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl fine
Yo, yo, Kanye, yo turn it up, a little bit, whoo

Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..

Yo, this is a Roc-a-Fella, St. Lunatics collaboration
Chi-Town and St. Louis
She said she ain't never seen Murphy Lee befo'

I called her back from an earlier beep
Fo' in the mornin' they be like &quot;Nah, I wasn't sleep&quot;
Convenient whore stay on top of convenient stores
Keep pictures of me in their Victoria Secret drawer
I keep somethin' hot on tour
Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in store
See I adore the ones that call me Tory, true story
I created 'hood rats so these new mice bore me
See I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait
Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates
So know I got elevens and twelves
With at least thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell
Hehehehehehehehe hell, I remember when she smashed LaBelle
See most women kinda sneaky like a six-year old
Hey yo they always in the summer, somethin' wrong with their nails

Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..

What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead
That you know don't like you?
She'll run over your head with a motorcycle
I mean the way you look is nice, but there's more to life boo
Cuz I could go to videos and get fo' just li
And I heard 'em say
nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
From the Chi, Like Tim, it's a Hardaway
till this is in the name of love, like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today,
can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer aids,
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Abu Akhbar be throwin' some hot cause
things we seein' on the screen not ours
but these niggas from the hood, so these dreams not far
where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
but they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it, uh
Chorus:
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll find a way
And nothin' lasts forever, but be honest baby
It hurts, but it may be the only way
They say people in your life for seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun-clappin' and keep to squeezin'
And gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'
In Jesus, and one day that she'll see him
Till then in walk his footsteps and try to be him,
The devil is alive, I feel him breathin'
Claimin' money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down,
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, sick of it now,
Chorus:
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll find a way
And nothin' lasts forever, but be honest baby
It hurts, but it may be the only way
With every worthless word we get more far away
And nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And nothin lasts forever, but be honest, baby
It hurts, but it may be the only way.In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless... oh
How could you be so heartless?

How could you be so,
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
And yo I know of some things that you ain't told me
And yo I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back
And you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend
Well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless... oh
How could you be so heartless?


How could you be so Dr. Evil
You're bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak so why we up 3 a.m. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me for, homie I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up cause I already know how this thing goes,
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see,
You'll never find nobody better than me

In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless... oh
How could you be so heartless?


Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk,
Baby lets just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
and you can't make it right
Im gon' take off tonight
In to the night...

In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless... oh
How could you be so heartless? *2 timesLike we always do at this time

Yo it's got to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

I'm a get on this TV mama, I'm a...
I'm a put shit down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good

Welcome to the good life
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
Cause they got more
Ass than the models
The good life, so keep it coming' with the bottles
Till she feel boozed like she bombed out Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C.
It feel like VA, or the Bay, or Ye
Ayy, this is the good life
Welcome to the good life

Homie, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood
Like I'm new in the hood, the only thing I wish?
I wish a nigga would
He probably think he could, but, but
I don't think he should
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

I'm a get on this TV mama, I'm a...
I'm a put shit down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While getting' some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen snakes on a plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get izz
Having money's the everything that having' it is
I was splurging' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas cause
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life

Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmama ain't the only girl calling me baby
And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh
I'm good.Artist: Kanye West
Album: Late Registration
Song: Hey Mama
Typed by: ricorendezvous@hotmail.com

(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cuz I?m so proud of you
Let me tell you what I?m about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I?m goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)

I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I?m finna let it shine
I?m finna take yall back to them better times
I?m finna talk about my mama if yall don?t mind
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn?t give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy cant you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy Imma love you till you don?t hurt no more
And when I?m older, you aint gotta work no more
And Imma get you that mansion that we couldn?t afford
See you?re, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that?s makin loot
A livin legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)


Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it?s things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of ?You, Are So Beautiful To Me??
Can?t you see, you?re like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nicky Giovanni, turn one page and there?s my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, yall say Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)


I guess it also depends tho, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)

Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
Imma get you a jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don?t gotta be Mother?s Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say (Hey Mama)
 (with variations)And you say Chi-City?
Chi-City, Chi-City

Im coming home again
Do you think about me now and then? Yea
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again, coming home again


I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I love most, she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me little homie, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Wendy, and
I like to blow trees" and
From that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tell 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she show me how to go downtown
And in the nighttime, her face lit up, so astound
And I told her, in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV, and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me"

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again, coming home again

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Ohh
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we could start again.

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport, to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you, and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do, just not new"
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'till it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that, when I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jumpin' a crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-town
(I'm coming home again)

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again, coming home again

Baby, do you remember when fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again, coming home again
Baby, do you remember when fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again, maybe we can start again.Oh oh ohoo.
damn, here we go again.
Oh oh ohoo.
Common passed on this beat, i made it to a jam,

now everything im not, made me everything i am.
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything im not, made me everything i am.

I never be picture-perfect
Be light as Al B. or black as Chauncey
Remember him from
He was as black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as his beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
Y'see how I creeped up?
Y'see how I played a big role in Chicago like?
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
but everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

and i'm back to tear it up
haters, start your engines
I hear 'em gearin' up
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops
they forget to get they haircut
okay fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
so say goodbye to the NAACP award
goodbye to the In-di-a Arie award
they'd rather give me the ni-nigga-please award
but I'll just take the I-got-alotta-cheese award

damn, here we go again.
but everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

I know people wouldn't usually rap this
but I got the facts to back this
just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
man, killin's some wack shit
oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
he got changed over his chains, a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
the church want tithes, so I can't afford to pay
the slip on my door, cause I can't afford to stay
my 15 seconds' up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today

damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
but everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I amFind your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

You say he get on your fuckin' nerves
you hope that he get what he deserves, word
do you even remember what the issue is
you just trying to find where the tissue is
you can still be who you wish you is
it ain't happen yet
and that's what the intuition is
when you hop back in the car
drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
the smokescreens
the chokes and the screams
you ever wonder what it all really mean

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

and I'm back on my grind
a psychic read my lifeline
told me in my lifetime
my name would help light up the Chicago skyline
and that's why I'm
7:00, that's primetime
heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
why he keep giving me hot lines
I'm a star, how could I not shine
how many ladies in the house
how many ladies in the house without a spouse
something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
what you about
on that independent shit
trade it all for a husband and some kids
you ever wonder what it all really mean
you wonder if you'll ever find your dreams.I need to recruit all the soldiers
All of God's soldiers
We at war...
We at war with society, racism, terrorism
But most of all...we at war with ourselves

(Jesus walks)
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walks with me, with me, with me, with me, with me)

You know what the mid-west is?
Young and Restless
Where restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (niggas) who Kanye West is. HUH!

I walk through the valley where the shadow of death is.
Top floor of the view alone will leave you breathless
Try to catch it ... it's kind of hard
Getting choked by detectives yeah yeah now check the method.
They be asking us questions, harass and arrest us
Saying We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit what's the basis?
We ain't going no where but got suits and cases.
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis.
My momma used to say only Jesus can save us.
Well momma I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone til November. I got packs to move I hope.

Chorus (2x)
(Jesus walks)
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now.
(Jesus walks)
And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong
(Jesus walks with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)

To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers...
(Jesus walks with them!)
To the victims of welfare feel we living in hell here, hell yea...
(Jesus walks with them!)
Now hear ye hear ye wanna see thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheist into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathy Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dawg radio needs this
They said you can rap anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk bout God my record won't get played
Huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope it take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin 'bout
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out...

(Jesus walks)
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now.
(Jesus walks)
And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong
(Jesus walks with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never, never know
Never know enough, til it's over love
Til we lose control, system overload
Screamin no, no, no, no, no
I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
You keep ya love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin' to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, In the danger zone
How many times did I take fo' it finally got through
you lose, you lose
I'm aint lovin you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life
which is wastin' time, where's the finish line

So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
You keep ya love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to
I met no one new, I got no one new
I know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin, keep the lovin gone
Keep it on a roll, only god knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
When i wanna go, I dont need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to

So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, you lose, you lose, you lose Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

She don?t believe in shootin' stars,
but she believe in shoes & cars
Wood floors in the new apartment,
couture from the store?s department
You more like "I love to start shit",
I?m more of the, trips to florida
Order the hors d'oeuvre, views of the Water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy,
man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy,
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a ?Oeur de Whopdee?
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggaz got me,
I hate these niggaz more than the Nazis

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

I know it?s been a while,
Sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay,
a-bay late-ly you been all on my brain,
And if somebody would?ve told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn?t wanna know
If somebody would?ve told me a year ago
it'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory?s museum,
I?m just saying, Hey Mona Lisa,
come home you know you can?t Rome without Caesar

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights

Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

Lights, lights, lights, lights

Man, at least a dude wit' a car
So first of all we gon' work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass!

1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came..
I came...

Hustlers, gangstas, all us, ballas

It's been a week without me

She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out

Why are you so paranoid?
Don't be so paranoid.
Don't be so

Baby don't worry bout it
Hey there don't even think about it
You worry bout the wrong things
The wrong thing


(Verse 1)
Tell me right now you really wanna spend your whole life alone?
A little time out might do you good, might do us good.
'Fore we be done for good.
Cuz i can make it good i can make it hood
I can make you come i can make you go
I can make it high i can make it fly
Make you touch the sky
Hey maybe so.

All the time you be up in my
Checking through my cellphone
Baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night?
Here's another fight
Oh here we go


(Chorus)
Baby don't worry bout it
Lady we'll go out to the floor

Anyway they don't know you like I do (They don't know)
They'll never know you (Never Know)
Anyway they don't know you like I do (Never Know)


(Verse 2)
All of the time you wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me
Show some gratitude
Leave the attitude way back at home
Yeah you see em look
Baby let em look
Give you cold looks cuz we look cold
Yeah you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world lost in the world
'Til you finally let that thing go
You wanna check into the heartbreak hotel
But sorry we're closed.


(Chorus)
Lady don't worry bout it
Baby we'll go out to the floor

Anyway they don't know you like I do (to they floor)
They'll never know you (Hey! never know)
Anyway they don't know you like I do (They don't know)


(Outro)
Baby don't worry bout it
Lady don't even think about
You worry bout the wrong things
The wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing

Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway they don't know you like I d
They'll never know you.I'm living in the 21st century doin' something mean to it
Do it better then anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the power
(21st century Schizoid Man)

The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose motherfucker we rollin',
Huh? motherfucker we rollin'
With some light skinned girls and some Kelly Rowland's
In this white man's world we the ones chosen
So goodnight cruel world I'll see you in the mornin',
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment.

No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the power
Till then, fuck that the world's ours
(21st Century Schizoid Man)

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my ass hole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes!
You short minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My child-like creativity, purity and honesty is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me, taking my inner child I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrust in me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece thinking...

No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the powder
Till then, fuck that the world's ours
(21st Century Schizoid Man)

Colin Powell, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well that's a pretty bad way to start a conversation
At the end of the day goddamn it I'm killin' this shit
I know damn well ya'll feelin' this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick
I ain't got a power trip who you going home with?
How 'Ye doin'? I'm Surviving
I was drinkin' earlier now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches huh? Where ya hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'...

(Oh hey Oh hey Oh hey
Hey Hey)

Now this'll be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window
I'm Letting everything go
I'm Letting everything go

You got the power to let power go flow
And I heard 'em say
nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
From the Chi, Like Tim, it's a Hardaway
till this is in the name of love, like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today,
can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer aids,
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Abu Akhbar be throwin' some hot cause
things we seein' on the screen not ours
but these niggas from the hood, so these dreams not far
where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
but they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it, uh
Chorus:
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll find a way
And nothin' lasts forever, but be honest baby
It hurts, but it may be the only way
They say people in your life for seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun-clappin' and keep to squeezin'
And gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'
In Jesus, and one day that she'll see him
Till then in walk his footsteps and try to be him,
The devil is alive, I feel him breathin'
Claimin' money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down,
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, sick of it now,
Chorus:
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll find a way
And nothin' lasts forever, but be honest baby
It hurts, but it may be the only way
With every worthless word we get more far away
And nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And nothin lasts forever, but be honest, baby
It hurts, but it may be the only way.singly Roads would never change your mind

Makes us harder, better, faster, stronger!''

''Work it harder make it better,
Do it faster makes us stronger,
More than ever, hour after hour,
Work is never over''

Now that don't kill me,
Can only make me stronger.
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer.
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger.
Man, I been waitin' all night now,
That's how long I've been on ya.

I need you right now,
I need you right now.

Let's get lost tonight,
You can be my black Kate Moss tonight.
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight,
And you don't give a fuck what they all say right
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior,
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore,
I ask 'cause I'm not sure,
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'Cause right now thou hast forsaken us.
You should be honored by my lateness,
That I would even show up to this fake shit.
So go ahead, go nuts, go ape shit,
Especially in my pastel, on my bape shit,
Act like you can't tell who made this,
New gospel, homey, take six, and take this, haters.

Now that don't kill me,
Can only make me stronger.

Me like it.

I don't know if you got a man or not,
If you made plans or not,
If God put me in your plans or not,
I'm trippin', this drink got me sayin' a lot.
But I know that God put you in front of me,
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me.
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment, right
'Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night,
So we gon' do everything that Kan like,
Heard they do anything for a Klondike,
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke.
And she'll do anything for the limelight,
And we'll do anything when the time's right,
Uh, baby, you're makin' it
Harder, better, faster, stronger,

Now that don't kill me,
Can only make me stronger, ''oh!''
I need you to hurry up now, ''oh!''

Since OJ had Isotoners,
Don't act like I never told ya.
Don't act like I never told ya.
Don't act like I never told ya.
Don't act like I never told ya.
Don't act like I never told ya.

''Ugh, baby, you're makin' it

''Work it harder, make it better, do it faster, makes us stronger, never over.''(In background)
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can that huh?
I spit it through the wire man
To much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kayne titter....
Chi-Town what's going on man

(Verse 1)
I drink a boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizerk
Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back wizzork
How do you console my mom or give her light support
When you telling her your sons' on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmit Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing them dynasty signs
I'm use to trying to reline
I been trying to be sign
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the making man

(In background)
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I really apologize how I sound right now man
This ain't fair at all man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru....
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth
I couldn't believe it
But im still here for yall right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah

(Verse 2)
What if somebody from the Chi-town was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't to cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep my safe book safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
it was televised
There`s been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

(In background)
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Know what im saying
When the doctor told me I had a um.. I was goin to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
Its bad I got all this jewelry on
Can't be serious ma
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'm a touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'm a touch the sky

Back when they thought pink polos would hurt the Roc,
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox.
Now let's go.
Take 'em back to the plan...
Me and my mama hopped in the U-Haul van.
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them,
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.
Let's take 'em back to the club.
Least about an hour I would stand on line,
I just wanted to dance.
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.
I just wanted to shine.
Jay's favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"
A hip hop legend,
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.


Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world
Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock,
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop,
I would do anything to say "I got it,"
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket.
Before anybody wanted K-West beats,
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC.
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns,
Like "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an aeroplane,
And I don't know if I'll be back again.
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets,
But when she came to kick it, things became different.
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on.
I couldn't keep it home, I thought I needed a Nia Long.
I'm trying to write my wrongs,
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song.
Now,

I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, You gonna touch the sky
You gonna touch the sky baby girl!
Testify, come up in the spot
Looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, You gonna touch the sky

Yes, yes, yes guess who's on third?
Lupe still like Lupin the Third.
Hear life here till I'm coke on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but been on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth's.
But, before you say another word,
I'm back on the block like a man on the street.
I'm trying to stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra,
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.
Engarde, Touch Lupe cool as the Unthar,
But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.
I come as correct as a porn star,
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.
So, I represent the first.
Now, let me hear my verse right where the horns are like


We back at home, baby
Sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
Sky, Sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
Yeah!
Keep it rollin'
Feels good to be home, baby! Feels good to be home!My friend showed me pictures of his kids,
And all I could show him were pictures of my cribs.
He said his daughter got a brand-new report card,
And all I got was a brand-new sportscar.

And my head keeps spinning,
Can't stop having these visions,
I gotta keep winnin'.
2x

Dad cracked a joke, all the kids laughed,
But I couldn't hear him all the way in first-class.
Chased the good-life, my whole life long,
Look back on my life, and my life gone,
Where did I go wrong?

And my head keeps spinning,
Can't stop having these visions,
I gotta keep winnin'.
2x

I've seen it, I've seen it before.
I've seen it, I've seen it before.
I've seen it, I've seen it before.
I've seen it, I've seen it before.

My god sister's gettin' married by the lake,
But I couldn't figure out who I'd wanna take.
Bad enough that I showed up late,
I had to leave before they even cut the cake.
Welcome to heartbreak.

And my head keeps spinning,
Can't stop having these visions,
I gotta keep winnin'.
2x
And I can- and I can't stop.
No, no, I can't stop.
No, no, no, no I can't stop.
No, no, no, no I can't stop.

I can't stop.
Can't stop.
Can't stop.

No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no.
I can't stop.

How much time you spent at the mall? All day, nigga
How many thots do you got on call? All day, nigga
H-how long they keep you in court? All day, nigga
Take you to get this fly? All day, nigga
Tell your P.O. how how long you been high? All day, nigga
Y'all already know I'm straight from the Chi, all day, nigga
South, south, south side! All day, nigga

It's Ye, nigga
Shoppin' for the winter, and it's just May, nigga
Ball so hard, man, this shit cray, nigga
And you ain't gettin' money 'less you got eight figures
From the Jesus piece, man I've been saved, nigga
Just talked to Farrakhan, that's sensei nigga
Told him I've been on ten since 10th grade, nigga
Got a middle finger longer than Dikembe, my nigga, uh
I don't let 'em play with me
I don't let 'em talk to me no kind of way
You better watch what you say to me
People still gettin' popped on the day to day
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you, ohh, it all falls down

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you, ohh, it all falls down

Man, I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny

Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore, three years, ain't picked a career
She like, fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair

'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new airs
'Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus

She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female, addicted to retail and well

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down

All of the lights,
All of the lights

Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

Fast cars, shooting stars
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

Cop lights, flash lights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, every night
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in
No matter what you'll never take that from me

My reign is as far as your eyes can see... its amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
I'm a monster I'm a killer

I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That will never ever be solved
No matter what you'll never take that from me

My reign is as far as your eyes can see... it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
You don't need me to ever write
I read your last message at least 1000 times
At least 1000, at least 1000 times
Alright, alright, alright
Why did you ever listen to
People trying to hate on you
At least you know that's nothing new
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby, you're awesome
So awesome

You look too good to be at work
You feel too good to ever hurt
I hope you ready for tonight
I'm gon cook, you'll be dessert
You can't be still
You gotta move, you gotta dance
I gotta live, I gotta love
I got a hope, I got a chance
Didn't you know I was waiting on you?
Waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know I was waiting on you?
My face turned to stone when I heard the news

When you decide to break the rules?
'Cause I just heard some real bad news
People talk like it's old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Stadium Status...

Uh...


My big brother was BIG's brother,
Used to Be Dame and BIG's brother,
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend,
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin.


It's the hard knock life tour, sell out,
Picture us in the mall coppin' iceberg and yell out jigga,
Yeah that's what we'll yell out,
You know the name do, i gotta spell out, or tell bout?

J.A.Y., and 'Ye so shy, now he won't even step to his idol to say hi.
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by,
Back of my mind, "he could change your life."
With all these beats i did, at least let him hear,
At least you can brag to your friends back at the gig.

But he got me out my mama' crib,
Then he helped me get my mama' a crib.


Big brother was BIG's brother,
Used to be Dame and BIG's brother,
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend,
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin.

Let the story begin.
If you feel the way i feel, why don't you wave your hands?


Fresh off the plane, I'm off the base line.
Nothin' handed out, I'm bout to take mine.
For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by any means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted

And you know it, and you know it
Whose fault?

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

On a bathroom wall I wrote
I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else
I took a piss and dismiss it, like fuck it
And I went and found somebody else

Fuck arguing or harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two am and I call back and I hang up
And I start to blame myself, somebody help

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking, and choking you

What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine

And you ain't fixin' to see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other nigga's stroking you
Lie and say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?

You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees

I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
And I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'mma need a little more time now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want somethin' out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it
So let's get on with it

We could've been somebody
'stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody

Just grab somebody, no leaving this party With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
All them other niggas lame, and you know it now
When a real nigga hold you down

You supposed to drown What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday They ordered champagne but still look thirsty Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty I know I got a bad reputation Walking 'round, always mad reputation

Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation I turnt the nightclub out of the basement I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complaining
La la la la

Wait 'til I get my money right
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message

I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny

And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talkin' like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hill, man
I guess the money should have changed him
I guess I should have forgot where I came from
La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me? Was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin', show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mmm hmm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted, layaway or a deposit
My daddy'd say "When you see clothes close your eyelids"
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey! hey! hey! hey!

Lifestyle on camera
Hundred thousand dollar chandelier

They tried to turn me to an animal
But white people think I'm radical
Supermodels think I'm handsome
You might think I'm too aggressive
Really I think I'm too passive

Til I pull out the chopper, start blastin'
1500, all in singles

Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Round and round they go
Round and round they go
Pray for me
I'm about to hit the Ye button
I don't wanna say nothin' wrong
But it'd be wrong if I ain't say nothin'
Imagine if I ain't say somethin'
Wasn't nothin', you could say nothin'
I done lost and made money
Now I'm makin' somethin' they can't take from me
Now I'm fresh out of debt in this mothafucka!
And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka!
Yeezy might have to go put his Louis on

I'm 'bout to go Gucci in the Gucci store
Fresh out the pen in this mothafucka

And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka
Gucci Mane and I'm 'bout to put my Yeezys on
Now that Gucci's home, it's over for you Gucci clones
1500, all in singles
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop

Round and round they go
Round and round they go

Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
Round and round they go
Round and round they go
Look, I say a prayer for my enemies
They cannot slow down what's meant for me
Funny how they come around like I can't see through their secret identities
Lately it's all about Zen and me
Subtractin' the negative energy
With the family, turn your ass to a memory
I'm with the team of the century
I blow the check up, detonation
Kill 'em one by one, Final Destination
Time my destination

I got guardian angels all around a nigga, that's the flexin' single

I got the World in my hands, the master plan
But I don't know why I keep calling
Why I keep all of these girls at my shows
They loving me but I don't know why
I keep calling
Why I keep calling you

All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now


I'm in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks
If you work with my people, speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call, out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel to lower Stone's walls
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I'm in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik
Get Olga Kurylenko, tell her I'm very single
Abbey Lee too, I'm a freak boo
I'm wilding, I'm on a thousand
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen


I got the World in my hands, the master plan
But I don't know why I keep calling
Why I keep all of these girls at my shows
They loving me but I don't know why
I keep calling
Why I keep calling you


Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I'm tryna eat out so what we going for dinner for


Miami nights on the search for some T and A
Tryna hide what's obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
What of the dollar you murdered for.
Is that the one fighting for your soul.
Or your brother's the one that you're running from.
But if you got money, fuck it, 'cause I want some.
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my.
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique.
Ain't nobody fresher than my motherfucking Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique.
As I look around, they don't do it like my Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique.
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the.
They want the, they want the.
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say.
My block behind me like I'm coming out the driveway.
It's grind-day, from Friday, to next Friday.
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day.
She tryna get me that poo tang.
I might let my crew bang.
My crew deeper than Wu Tang.
I'm rolling with fuck I'm saying?
Girl, you know my crew nameYou know 2 Chainz?
Scrrr!
I'm pullin' up in that Bruce Wanye.
But I'm the fuckin' villain, man, they kneeling when I'm walking in the building.
Freaky women I be feelin' from the bank accounts I'm fillin'.
What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be.
Young player from the D that's killin' everything that he see.
Kanye West!
DJ Khaled!

Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?

Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik
I told you mahfuckas it was more than the music
In the projects one day, to Project Runway
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
On lonely nights I start to fade
Her love is a thousand miles away
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again

Memories made in the coldest winter

It's 4am and I can't sleep
You might think you've peeked the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago

It may just sound all whack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fiction, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen

Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo

We drowned sorrow in that Diablo,
Me found bravery in my bravado
I love it though
I love it though

Uh put your hands to the constellations
they way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
we love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
we aint married but tonight I need some consummation

may the Lord forgive us
may the God's be with us
and that magic hour I seen good christians make rash decisions
oh she do it, what happened to Religion?
oh she lose it
she putting on her make up
she casually allure
text message break up, the casualty of tour
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

Diamonds are forever

Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?...

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz

It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
he write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

Explain yourself, how you sound like me?

The muthaf-cking skateboard P

Knowing that your mee lo

Playing games like you're cee-lo

In a tight situation like speedo's

You can have it your way like Carlito

My n-gga will be happy to give you torpedos

And have you car twisted like a blunt

For you faggot a-s n-ggas that like to front

I'm on some BBC bape sh-t

I'm on some cake sh-t

In the kitchen with the heat making beats in my apron

You hating and you want to erase it

Close your eyes when you know you can't take it

My flow interupts your homeostasis

I Rolls Royce it on a regular basis

You talk street sh-t it sound like sweet sh-t

Straight liquorice you n-ggas sound ticklish

80k large for the Hermes dream

Coke n crop in all your magazines

Hunger strike yourself, look like Celine

Dion, me and my n-ggas like frion

You b-tches on my pecan b-tch

She got an a-s you can eat on

Try to play tough like the leather on a Vuitton

I hit it til I could seat on

Try to get her freak on

Ask me to R Kelly ya and get pee'd on
Oh, oh, ohoo
Damn, here we go again
Oh, oh, ohoo
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam

Now everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

I never be picture perfect Beyonce
Be light as Albi or black as Chauncey
Remember him from BLACKstreet
He was as black as the street was

I'll never be laid back as his beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake ass facade they couldn't keep up
Y'see how I creeped up?

Y'see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.Am
Let me know if you feel it man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am
Dirt and grime and filth inside
The story of my lifetime
Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are

Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman


Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
Herzog and Adidas, man you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man they wouldn't have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum
Every time I talk they say I'm too aggressive
Your love is fadin'
Your love is fadin'
Your love is fadin'
I feel it's fadin'

When no one ain't around
I feel it's fadin'
I think I think too much
I feel it's fadin'
Ain't nobody watchin'

I feel it's fadin'

I just fade away

I feel it...
Fade away

Hold up, hold up
Po' up, po' up

I'ma rock the boat
Work the middle 'til it hurt a little
Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Swizz told me let the beat rock

For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous
They mad they're still nameless
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous
Yeah we still hood famous

I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did

From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Wake up, Mr West! Oh, he's up!
I just wanted you to know
You're the only power
You're the only power that can
You're the only power
You're the only power that can, ohhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh

Flashing lights
Flashing lights

Flashing lights

She don't believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes & cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's department
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit
I'm more of the, trips to Florida
Order the h'orderves, views of the water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like "Where are you Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these nigga's got me

I been waiting for a minute
For my, lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul, my soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
She take my money when I'm in need
Yea she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh she's a gold digger way over town
That digs on me

Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz

Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you ROC, I can tell by ya charm
Far as girls you got a flock
I can tell by ya charm and ya arm

But I'm lookin' for the one
Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
An I gotta take all they bad ass to showbiz

Ok, get yo' kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got a pen
We all went to Den and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you betta be payed
You know why?
But it's too late, it's too late
He gone

You sweat her, and I ain't talkin' 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
Brother Numpsay! Groupies sound too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way

Too late, we gone, we strivin' home
Gone, we ride on chrome
It's too late

Y'all don't want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught somethin' on the Usher tour he had to "Let it Burn"
Plus he already got three chil'run
Arguin' over babysitters like, "Bitch, it's yo' turn!"
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you
Even your superficial raps is super official
Are-are-are-Roc pastel with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long
Cause the dookie's on any song that they threw me on, gone

We strivin home, gone
I ride on chrome
We strivin' home, gone
Killa, I ride on chrome

Knock knock, who's there
Killa Cam, Killa who
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, gorilla true
Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
I g-go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

I'ma get on this TV mama, I'ma

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good

Welcome to the good life
Where niggaz that sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living' spree
Shit they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ahh
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry
Yo it's got to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lowry's
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Is hip hop, just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo's smilin' they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
I need to call it off, I need to make it known
'nother one, something gone, Capricorn
Dancing out on the lawn
Fancy like the things she likes
She lives her life, I'm living mine
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop, chop, chop
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan

Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray
Maybe it's cause
She into Leos and I was into trios
Plus all the trips to Rio, couldn't have helped

It's gettin' cold, better bring your ski clothes
Uhh, yeah And I heard 'em say
Nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
From the Chi, like Tim, its the Hardaway
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today,
Can I at least get a raise
On the minimum wage?
And I know the government administered AIDS
so I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allah o Akhbar jus' throw him some hot cars
Cause the things we see on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars
I know it, uhh
And I heard 'em say
In the night, I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told
High lights
Tell my baby I'm back in town
High lights
Tell everybody I'm back in town
High lights
Tell my baby I'm back in town
High lights
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights
Can we play that back one time?
And after that night I'm gon' wanna play shit back, I don't know
Sometimes I'm wishin' that my dick had GoPro
So I could play that shit back in slo-mo
I just shot an amateur video; I think I should go pro
We only makin' the highlights
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be mine

One life, one night
High lights

I can hold my liquor
But this man can't handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga

But you really just know the old me

Bitch I'm back out my coma
Waking up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your corolla
Okay, I smashed your corolla
I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
Yeah
And you say Chi City
Chi City, Chi City

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again, 'min' home again

I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Wendy and I like to blow trees"

And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from outta town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their act 'cause she know they soft

And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
And at nighttime my face lit up, so astoundin'
And I told her in my heart is where she always be
She never mess with entertainers 'cause they always leave

Blazin, mi don't want dem
Mi need dem
Blazin
Suh mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
And now she find out what life is really worth
No to X rated
Yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
And now she find out what life is really worth
No to X rated

I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

I am a god
Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn mnage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a god
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hands of God
So y'all better quit playing with God

Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

Damn your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bath water on
And you turn off your iPhone

Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hand, legs, eatin' ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last

Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass

Chasin' love, lot of bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

That's all them can do
That's all them can do
We deal with action thing
Just a badman thing a dat dem cab do
Action thing yo a badman thing

Man a badman you fi know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way Jose
Try that 'pon February the 30th
Thats hard, couldn't try that no day
Ready, Huh
Yo
We at war

We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all we at war with ourselves

God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down

You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless might snatch your necklace
And next these might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time

I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time

I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
Down the time

I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a city
And I'm down for the night, down for the night

Says she's down for the night

I'm never alone
Down the time

I'm lost in the world
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screamin' "No! No! No! N-No!"
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you

So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
You lose

I'm not lovin' you the way I wanted to
You want me to give you a testimony about my life, and how good he's been to me. I don't know what to tell you about him, I love him so much with all my heart and my soul with every bone in my body I love him so much because he's done so much for me. 

I never liked you n-ggas
Who knew one day I'd be just like you n-ggas
Uh uh uh alright you n-ggas
Uh uh uh alright you n-ggas
When I become my mama's boyfriends?
When I become my mama's boyfriends?

He walked in our lives
I was only five
Superman pajama's I was super duper fly
Sitting here like why, he at least supersize
You know I scrutinise like who this newer guy
I'm my mama boyfriend I'm her little husband
I was the man of the house when there wasn't
Trying to get to know homie just kill the charm
You ain't interested in me you just tryna f-ck my mum
We are the voices of our parents bad choices
The aftermath of divorces
The kids of bitter split ups
And baby sitters
Grand parents that don't know what to do with us
And the last thing I want to see is mama's new n-gga
You old Old Spice wearing
Well! It is a weeping and a moaning and a gnashing of teeth

It is a weeping and a mourning and a gnashing of teeth

When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound, believe!

Lamborghini Mercy

Come and have a good time with G.O.D

I believe there's a god above me
I'm just the god of everything else
I put holes in everything else
"New God Flow," fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer, write it in bold letters
They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Pusha ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the Ye as a wholesaler
I think it's good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper, matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think '99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him
Goin' HAM in Ibiza done took a toll on us

Well if you goin' coupe, I'm goin' four door

Fuck em 'Ye, fuck em 'Ye!
I wouldn't piss on that nigga with Grand Marnier They shitty shoppin' at Targt
Im ballin', Amar'e
A nick sold in the park then I want in
What's a king without a crown, nigga?
What's a circus without you clown niggas?

My momma was raised in an era when,
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself.
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And there's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come here, please buy more"
What you want a Bentley, fur coat and diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things
Used to only be niggas now everybody play me
Spending everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves

You see it's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

You see it's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
La di da da-a, da-a

Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee

Yeezy season approaching
Fuck whatever y'all been hearing
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearing
A monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me

Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes
Why are you so paranoid?
Don't be so paranoid.
Don't be so

Baby don't worry bout it
Hey there don't even think about it
You worry bout the wrong things
The wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things
The wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things
The wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things
The wrong things

A little time out might do you good, might do us good fore we be done for good.
Coz I can make it good I can make it hood I can make you come I can make you go
I can make it high I can make it fly make you touch the sky hey maybe so
All the time you be up in my checking through my cellphone baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night? Here's another fight
Oh here we go
Wise men say
You'll never figure out real love

Its so crazy
I got everything figured out
but for some reason I can never find what real love is about
no doubt
everything in the world figured out but I can never seem to find what love was about

do you think I sacrifice real life
for all the fame, like flashing lights
do you think I sacrifice, a real life
for all the fame, and flashing lights

There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
to get my heart out of this Hell
and my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
that could turn back a time
I'm living' in that 21st century
Doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking', I just count the hours
Stop tripping', I'm tripping' off the power

The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We ain't got nothing' to lose, ma' fucka', we rolling
Huh? Ma'fucka', we rolling'
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man's world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm trippin' off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours

And then they and then they
And then they and then they
And then they and then they
Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' after communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...


Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'd turn my life to Stephen King
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like Im on parole
I told her there's some things she
dont need to know
She never let it go
Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Ok, Ok, Ok
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it
now... drop it... drop it


Cause I dont want no Robocop
You moving like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop?
Now I dont need no Robocop


Just looking at your history
You like the girl from Misery
She said she aint take

And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

She find pictures in my email
I sent this girl a picture of my dick.
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good with that shit.
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

See, I always find
And I always find
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit


My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission, on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

And you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
The night sky, yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah


Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake, sleepless in you

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Then play you will
I pray you will

Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killing, while I'm drilling
Tattoos, how they break the news

Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both sucked like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be going hard, I got a name to prove
Killing 'em, honey how I make the pain improve
Yeezy, Yeezy, what's good?

Two hands in the air if you don't really care

Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

Balding, Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby you're fired, your girlfriend hired
And if you don't mind I'm'a keep you on call

We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that chew a fuckin' hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers

Housekeeping, I mean got damn one time
Let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos

Will be the same day MTV played videos
That was a little joke -- voila!
Praises due to the most high -- Allah

Praises due to the most fly -- Prada
Baby I'm magic -- ta da!
Address me as your highness
High as United, thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited

Niggas be writin' bullshit like they gotta work

Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit is, fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

How should I begin this, I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have installed

I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark knight feeling, die or be a hero
Let me know, do I still got time to grow
Things ain't always set in stone
With that being, let me know
Let me

The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
It is true, the makings of you, oh

I do it for the fore-fathers and the street authors
that are not A&R's in the cheap office
rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
girls thats way too fine for us to keep off us
gave her a handshake only for my man's sake
she in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake
now there's crumbs all over the damn place
and she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood
taking refills of that plan B pill
another shorty that won't make it to the family will
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will
they aint crazy they don't know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty so it's not that bad
but I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had

A little sugar, honey suckle lamb
Great expression of happiness
Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can they huh?
I spit it through the wire man
It's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation, man

Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy Kanye to the
Chi-Town what's going on
Uh huh, yeah, yeah
I drink a boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizerk
Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back wizzork

How do you console my mom or give her light support

Telling her, her sons' on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmit Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing that dynasty sign
I'm use to trying to reline
I've been trying to be sign
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, I made up in my mind
I'm doin' things my way, I'm burnin' shit down tonight
I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway
Let me say it one more time

Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, to the world, to the world
To the world, to the world, to the world
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
Middle fingers up!

Deuces minus one
Middle finger to the sky tonight
The whole world is a couch
Bitch I'm Rick James tonight
Throw it up, throw it up
Cause you can't take it with you
Funny how they wait 'til you gone just to miss you
To the world, to the world
Featuring Lupe Fiasco

I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'm a touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'm a touch the sky

Back when they thought pink polos would hurt the Roc,
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox.
Now let's go.
Take 'em back to the plan...
Me and my mama hopped in the U-Haul van.
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them,
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.
Let's take 'em back to the club.
Least about an hour I would stand on line,
I just wanted to dance.
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.
I just wanted to shine.
Jay's favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"
A hip hop legend,
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.

I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'm a touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'm a touch the sky

Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world
Yes, God)
We don't want no devils in the house, God
We want the lord
And that's it
Hallej- hand over Satan
Jesus praise the Lord
Hallelujah, God
We don't want no devils in the house, God
We want the lord
And that's it
Hallej- hand over Satan
Jesus praise the Lord

I'm tryna keep my faith
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
This is everything
Deliver us serenity
Deliver us peace
Deliver us loving
We know we need it
You know we need it
You know we need it
That's why we need you now, oh, I
Pray for Paris
Pray for the parents
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam

This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything
Turn it up!

Step up in this bitch like
I'm the one your bitch like
Yeah I'm the one your bitch like
And I be talkin' shit like
I ain't scared to lose a fistfight
And she grabbin' on my dick like
She wanna see if it'll fit right
That's just the wave

Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Kanye:
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all i could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card
And all i got was a brand new sports car

Kid cudi:
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions I gotta get with it
Ohhoo ohhoo
Ohhhhoooo
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions I gotta get with it
Ohhoo ohhoo
Ohhhhoooo

Kany:
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laughed
But i couldn't hear 'em all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone... where did I go wrong?

Kid cudi:
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions I gotta get with it

Just me and you girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you girl
Wooooaah ohhh


Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Aren't you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown, you asleep with no make-up
I'm just tryna be inside you 'fore you wake up


Just me and you girl
Wooooaah ohhh


We had problems but it's all in the past
Everybody got problems baby, algebra class
Remember I used to do things that'd make you laugh
Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like pia coladas, getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But, they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Ain't no denying baby you have changed


Us living as we do upside down.
And the new word to have is revolution.
People don't even want to hear the preacher
spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued.
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey.
The youngsters who were programmed to continue
fucking up woke up one night digging
Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys.
Lost and beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
Right 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there

Lost and, found now
Turn down, I'm lost
Daddy, found out
How you turned out, how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
I need you now
I do, love you
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
If your mama, knew how
You turned out
You too wild
You too wild, you too wild

You too wild, and I need you now

Lost and found now
I, I'm not sorry

I always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
Wow, one day, they tried to bring me down
ALways knew that one day, they would try to bring me down
Down, way down


We gon' to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you evern wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin, that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some lee way on the he say she say
You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say No able ingle
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't hurt myself
Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself
And I'm a look in the mirror if I need some help
Ask me from the heart, y'all all frontin
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel somethin

Why you come here, I bet it only it was forget to get you
What kind of dream we found, see I'm often at your cross way
forgetting it was that heaven let you. They tried to bring me down

I used an exclamation just to be an asshole and also to make a point! LOL
And I used a period because contrary to popular belief I strongly dislike exclamation points!
On another note, I strongly dislike suit jackets. I used the word dislike because I hate the word hate.
I love you.
I have so much love in my heart and we just need the shot to create live breathe.
I love you guys.
Everyone has made mistakes. I just make them in public.
Don't hide from the truth because it is the only light.
Don't be mad at the truth. When you don't like me you are merely shooting the messenger.
Don't be scared of the truth because we need to restart the human foundation in truth
They think we're stupid. They do not know how to communicate.
When companies doubt me they doubt us.
That dreams will actualize. Dreams will manifest.
I have a dream.
Eventually the guys with real ideas not running a scam on the world will overcome.
They can't kill us all.
They can't kill us all.
I speak yell scream directly at the old guard on behalf of the future.
The Pablo pop up was almost a pop up of influence.
We are here to make life better.
And I promise the power is in the people and I will use the power given by the people to bring everything I have back to the people.
I speak truth to power!!!
I represent the dreamers.
in the past the press/old guard and powers that be would have silenced me a long time ago but I have a form of social immunity.
thank God for paps thank God for social media
We will find freedom in truth as opposed to ridicule.
We no longer have to be scared of the truth
We will breathe clean air and exercise the first amendment.
We will not get bullied by perception any longer. We will give our opinions.
We will change that. We will rise.  We will have a voice.
In Roman times the artist would contemplate proportions and colors. Now there is only one important color... Green
Let's fight for our future. We can change everything.
I stand with the utmost humility. We are so blessed!!! All praises and blessings to the families of people who never gave up on dreams
I promise I will never let the people down. I want a better life for all!!! Pablo Pablo Pablo Pablo!
This is the people the culture the dreams the future.
but there is no other brand that could sell 1 million dollars of clothing in 2 days from 1 location!!!
but there is no other brand that could sell 1 million dollars of clothing in 2 days from 1 location!!!

Thank you Kirk for standing by me through all the noise.
The choir arrangement that Kirk orchestrated is the most powerful thing I've heard in my earthly existence.
A lot of people tell me Ultralight Beam is my greatest artwork to date only rival being Jesus Walks.
Be strong today little bro!  Come to me, all of you who are tired and have heavy loads, and I will give you rest. MATTHEW 11:28
I just received a blessing from minister Kirk Franklin
Olivier designed clothes for my show That was real,   that was groundbreaking,  that is a Real Friend.
Be real
Be real
Dont try to use me for advertisement or to make your proposed trend relevant.
If you wouldnt invite me to your house then dont invite me to your show.
Fake Fake Fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake  just my analysis
So many people turned on her when she was fired and acted like they forgot the innovation and beauty that she brought to the world
The fashion world is sooooooo fake and Carine is one of the very few real people in fashion
I like T-shirts and women in yoga pants I live in LA thats what people wear not sure why someone would put a suit jacket on with that.
All these journalists can give their opinions well these are mineyes I believe in my ripped homeless sweaters!!!
Sorry I couldnt be at Virgils show because I had a meeting in another city.
this is my friend and we've bounced ideas and references for years since the time when he designed for YEEZY Season 1.
I thank Demna for using the "I feel like Pablo" sweatshirts in his show,
I thank Olivier for designing his collection around my wife this is visionary as I believe that Kim is our modern day everything.
Oh and I only came to Paris fashion to stand by my friends Olivier, Riccardo and Demna.
Just cause somebody is wearing combat boots doesnt mean its all of a sudden youth.
I also hate all the stylists that copy Hedi Slimane and give their clients blatant YSL looks thinking that it will bring a younger client.
I feel we are so stuck in the past and tradition.
I especially hate suit jackets on women that was a groundbreaking idea 5 million years ago!
I dont personally like suit jackets anymore.
excited to see my family and finish the final mixes of the Life of Pablo and keep working on Turbo Grafx 16 and Season 4 .
Im on a plane coming back from Europe

Thank you to @asvpxrocky for supporting me at the MSG show
I guess in a media world where you never hear the truth, the truth can come off as crazy
Its been a lot of confusion in the past 3 weeks so let me apologize for in any way being confusing
. @Adidas is making a million Yeezys this year, opening up new factories

please avoid trying to talk me out of being me in the future
Growing and learning but not being told to stop ...not being stunted.
I want people to be the best version of themselves and I will be the best version of me.
question... Why do people not want me to be me?
uuuuuuum, so there it is... No more CDs from me
the Yeezus album packaging was an open casket to CDs r.i.p
I was thinking about not making CDs ever again... Only streaming
Uuuuum... hi everybody!

I want to stream you performing in a Minnie Mouse head on @TIDALHiFi
Im very detailed oriented and I will know the difference so dont try to just throw a bow on the original head
I need you to perform at her party with specifically a minnie mouse dead-mow-five head not a mickey mouse dead-mow-five head.
can you please bring the minnie mouse head  not yours   she specifically likes minnie mouse 
Do you do birthday parties?? My daughter loves Minnie mouse
# Im bored  ### when you get married will your wife have a giant minnie mouse head? # This brightened up my day thank you dead-mow-five
# hash tag you raised Tidals subscriptions by a whopping downloads
# ok another super serious question   ...  is there a portable fan situation?
# whose job is it to carry the head on the plane # hash tag #  do you check the mickey mouse head or carry on #  does it get  hot?
# ok very serious question
@Deadmau5  is this persons name pronounced dead-mow-five?

It is so inspiring.Thank you for existing!
and also lets shout out to the art direction  candy on the screens!
I just want to thank Will Ferrell for the years of joy he has brought into my life with amazing comedy
We all know Will Ferrell has always been the one!!!
that showed how sharp and Bruce Lee status he is.
Perhaps it was seeing him play the same character from 15 years ago with 15 more years experience
His existence is a blessing.
Will Ferrell has reached walking living breathing god status!
I saw Zoolander 2 for the 2nd time
correction, the name of the Neo Geo game I was referring to was The Super Spy
We actually played Spy Hunter at my moms house!!!
My boy Mali that I spoke about on the song Drive Slow actually had a Neo Geo in real life bro
Blazing Lazers was probably my favorite game on that console 
just on some super nerd vibes one of my favorite gaming systems when I was a kid
My next album is titled"Turbo Grafx 16" as of now
This best explains my experience in fashion and with fashion people in general   https://t.co/rY7o51TDss

Kirk Franklin just sent me a blessing. I needed that. Thank you minister.
There are some lame fake accounts trying to make Kanye-isms that are not Mark Twain level.
Hi @Jack Dorsey, can you guys please take down all the fake Kanye accounts.
Hi @Jack Dorsey, can you guys please take down all the fake Kanye accounts.
I'm not a rapper.
I just thought of the craziest idea of all ... I'm going to sell winter coats in the winter!!!
I'm going to steal Demna from Balenciaga
You won't always agree with me but I'm gon always be me. I'm woke!
The world needs a guy like me. The world needs somebody to not be scared and tell his truth.
I love being a voice of freedom when so many people are scared to speak up.
I represent what people can't say.
New album coming this summer
I'm not even gon lie to you. I love me so much right now.
And yes I've talked to Adidas and we gon hook y'all up with free Yeezys and Adidas.  All positive vibes.
That is one of the reasons I respect the paps so much.
Respect to everyone working hard to keep a roof over their kids
What is your definition of true freedom? There is no true freedom without economic freedom.
I just had to start with shoes so that I could be economically empowered enough to have a voice.
You guys will see my heart. You guys will feel my heart. We will make a difference.
It's a beautiful time.  I love my friends. I love my family.  I love people. The human race.
Free from being held back by public opinion.
I'm happy and free and proud and confident. I'm not crazy. I'm free
I'm proud as an entrepreneur that I gave everything I had to my dreams.
I'm proud as an entrepreneur that I gave everything I had to my dreams.
I wrote Saint Pablo after admitting to my greatest shame my personal debt. But I'm not ashamed anymore.
No slave mindset no more. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free.
I'm not crazy I'm free.
People ask why I speak in a public forum... Well my voice is my power. Freedom of speech. Freedom of opinion. Freedom of dreams.
We need to see Young Thug at the Grammys.  Not just me and Jay in a suit.
First order of business. We the people need to see Future at the Grammys.
and always remember that rock and roll was stolen and don't try to hide behind Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis  all positive vibes.
Us real music guys wanna have fun too
Neil please reach out as soon as possible so we can make the Grammys culturally relevant again.
All artists have a problem with it and I am going to fix it for us all starting right now.
Has anyone at the Grammys ever heard March Madness??? Yes I have a problem with the Grammys.
You like your black people a certain way also. You wouldn't have Future perform and that man owned the clubs last summer.
You guys are supposed to be all about taste.
Dexter didn't feel he even had a chance of winning and he was right!!!
Everybody with any form of taste knows that was the best video of the year!
I don't want to just fix the awards for me but I want to fix it for Dexter Navy who directed A$AP Rockys LSD video.
If I'm not at the show next year then there is no show.
Hi Grammys this is the most important living artist talking.
I feel the Grammy awarding system is way off and completely out of touch.
I feel the Grammy awarding system is way off and completely out of touch.
I don't give opinions because they are commonly agreed upon. I say what I feel.
We need to fix this.
I know so many cool artists whose hearts have been broken by the politics including mine.
I think the Grammys are super important!!!
I would like to sit down with Neil Portnow right now
I really didnt mean to use the B word tonight      all positive vibes
God bless the fools  all positive vibes!
Ezrin I truly feel sorry for your friends and family that they have had to suffer an idiot like you for so many years
Welcome to pop culture!!!
I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne in one year and wasnt nominated for either and you know who has 2 albums of the year.
Rock and Roll was stolen Rap was exploited
its guys like you that run companies and dont invest in Ye even if Im your kids idol!!!
Bob please never speak in public again you are everything that is wrong with the old guard 
Bro you said Macklemore was more important musically than me no offense to Macklemore, hes a nice human being!
Im so sorry for them   I will send them free Yeezys to make up for the embarrassment that you have caused your family!
Your kids are ashamed of their dad  Sorry for speaking about kids  but could you imagine if you were Bob Ezrins kids
Do something relevant Please dont speak on me bro ever again!!!
Im tired of old people that have no connection with anything trying to comment on music!
What the fuck does he know about rap
What the fuck does he know about rap
Has anybody ever heard of Bob Ezrin???
If you are an entrepreneur you may have debt and lawsuits #facts

Drake would come by and just help, no strings. Future also came by to write. We all got new shit together that's gonna drop soon.
I wanna thank my brother Drizzy for helping me on 30 Hours &amp; Father Stretch My Hands.
Season 4 begins. Premire Vision https://t.co/LAlvRnlUgG
My number one enemy has been my ego  there is only one throne and thats God's  
In rap we have been developing a brotherhood
There is so much positive energy right now   Lets stay on this Ultra Light Beam
A wise man should be humble enough to admit when hes wrong and change his mind based on new information
Some rappers got the club  Some got the radio some got the consciencesome got the streets Everybody has something they do the best
every rapper is somebodys favorite
that statement hast been sitting well with me Thats a dated mentality   ... Im not on that 
Man, I was thinking about when I commented on the idea of "taking the rap throne 
Just creating in a fun simple way with no politics
Imagine if the people I named went to high school 2gthr and had a project to do for school
Imagine if the people I named went to high school 2gthr and had a project to do for school
all with one purpose of creating  beautiful product that can be attainable by everyone
A dream of mine would be to do a project where I  work side by side with Raf Simmons,  Helmut Lang, Vanessa Beecroft and Martin Margiela
Stream THE LIFE OF PABLO on https://t.co/shjFIS65Ia
Hey Nicolas Ghesquiere I grew up on Tron too Lets be best friends!!!
Id rather teachers got paid more and books cost less  #2020
We have to lower the price of textbooks
Education puts Americans into debt before they even get a chance to get started
Steve Jobs wanted to lower the cost of textbooks
shes giving everything she has to make sure her son has a better future
I mean, his mom has to work 2 days just to afford 1 book for her son 
Her son just got in a really good school and his textbooks are like $400 dollars each 
I have a friend who works really hard and makes $370 dollars a day
All positive energy
so many people were inspired  and thats all I wanted
MSG was amazing 
You let me dream without limits.
They provided resources for me to create they supported me   I thank you so so much  
Adidas has really made all the difference 
Thank you Adidas  for supporting my creative vision 
Thank you Adidas  for supporting my creative vision 
Pablo is full of joy and love because I was able to create.
I hope these words and this moment of truth can serve as some extra motivation to you
for anybody listening to Pablo now, working on a dream
so people laughed when I said I wanted to be able to take care of my family 
but if you dont have your paper right, there's a chance that your family can be broken up
when Sway was telling me what to do, I was in debt, and had a child
When Charlemagne was calling me "donkey of the day" I was in debt
I can see the clouds separating 
Im  an artist  the definition of art - or at least my definition - is to be able to see the truth and then express it...
I dont have to be cool
perhaps a fashion group will cover the 53 that Ive invested over the past 13 years
Perhaps Adidas will do some big Lebron style deal or  
my dreams brought me into debt and Im close to seeing the light of day
this country was built off of dreamers    never give up on your dreams, bro
You can point fingers and laugh, but for all entrepreneurs with families  ...
I wanted the world to know my struggle
Money doesnt make me who I am
You cant control me or use the debt against me no more   
For the past 3 years people who knew about the debt tried to use it against me in negotiations 
For the past 3 years people who knew about the debt tried to use it against me in negotiations 
only problem I got with Good Fridays is I got more songs than I got old pictures!!!! Lol!!!!
Also all Good Fridays songs will be on Tidal. Me and Kendrick got 40 songs and me and Young Thug got 40 songs. 40/40 club!!!
Please to all my friends fans and music lovers. Sign up to Tidal now.
My album will never never never be on Apple. And it will never be for sale... You can only get it on Tidal.
This was made with love. Only God can judge me. So I only expect love back!!!
Shut the fuck up and enjoy the greatness.
Aight then 
Don't tell me Lebron had a bad game. What yo jump shot look like???
The system is designed for colored people to fail and one of our only voices is music. One of our only ways out is music.
I love love love white people but you don't understand what it means to be the great grandson of ex slaves and make it this far.
To Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, New York Times, and any other white publication. Please do not comment on black music anymore.
Puff Daddy is the most important cultural figure in my life. His influence means everything to me.
Pitchfork, the album is a 30 out of 10
People wanted me to tweet again well here's some tweets!!!
and a balance art family perception friends family politics and the fucking manipulators
No matter what level you're at in life there is still a struggle
but if the self proclaimed cockiest person in the world can lay his personal business on the line then please people see my heart.
This is a God dream
I know I confuse you guys sometimes but please bare with me.
I know I confuse you guys sometimes but please bare with me.
I am ultra light beaming right now. So many people have called or emailed to help today hedge fund guys billionaires etc...
I am of service to the world with my art and I just want to serve more.
and I think the idea of being a celebrity a lot of times blocks the understanding of what my purpose is.
There are people who support artist and philanthropist
I could not have done the MSG without Adidas but world, what I'm telling you is that was just a small sketch for what I will bring you.
Also for anyone that has money they know the first rule is to use other people's money.
If I spent my money on my ideas I could not afford to take care of my family. I am in a place that so many artist end up.
but I need access to more money in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world.
Yes I am personally rich and I can buy furs and houses for my family
I want to help the world and I need help to do it. I am an artist and I care about humanity.
I just feel rich people are always too cool to ask for help trying to impress each other at dinner parties.
...on another note, can brah be the girl verson of bruh???
and yes there are misspellings on this chart thats how you know its me...
All you guys had meetings with me and no one lifted a finger to help.
I promise Im going to make the world dope. all I do is make shit dope #facts
if you want to help help me
youd rather open up one school in Africa like you really helped the country
All you dudes in San Fran play rap music in your homes    but never help the real artists
hey Larry Page Im down for your help too 
hey Larry Page Im down for your help too 
Here is my Donda chart that I wrote 4 years ago that everyone laughed at https://t.co/g1po6Z3H55
I know I can make the world a better place I have done the impossible  I retook the throne of rap I beat the fashion game
and I will always respect you for that and the world will love you
one of the coolest things you could ever do is to help me in my time of need
Mark, I am publicly asking you for help
I dont have enough resources to create what I really can
Im this generation's Disney I want to bring dope shit to the world
World, please tweet, FaceTime, Facebook, instagram, whatever you gotta do to get Mark to support me
You love hip hop, you love my art I am your favorite artist but you watch me barely breathe and still play my album in your house 
Mark Zuckerberg  I know its your bday but can you please call me by 2mrw
I put Lowlights on my album just thinking about all the moms driving they kids to school then going to work
Bars are worth more than money because it's something the people can use everyday to feel inspired.
I know y'all tired of music controlled by money and perception.  I'm proud of every dime of debt I got.
All y'all so worried about being likable but only a few are concerned about being great!!!
I am the Jordan and Steph Curry of music, meaning I'm the best of 2 generations.
I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne in one year and wasn't nominated for either ... I will have over 100 Grammys before I die.
I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne in one year and wasn't nominated for either ...

This is all all is fun all in good feelings... We will all be gone 100 years from now but what did we do to help while we were here!!!
I write this to you my brothers while still 53 million dollars in personal debt... Please pray we overcome... This is my true heart...
Let's dance in the streets. I am consumed by my purpose to help the world.
All memes are wrong... The Life of Paul... The life of Pablo... Ultralight beams... Moms dads daughters sons stand up...
Please forgive the profanity and give hugs and blessings to my brother Kirk for standing by me... In a few hours the journey begins...
He was saved from persecution due to his Roman citizenship... I have the right to speak my voice...
He was a learned man not of the original sect so he was able to take the message to the rest of the world...
Paul ... The most powerful messenger of the first century... Now we stand here 20 centuries later... Because he was a traveler...

Ive given everything I had for this moment a lot of people feel its the paradigm shift 
fashion aint no joke for me Its a way of life creative expression and industry
so many people didnt make it and gave everything they had for me to stand on their shoulders and break through fashion
Your site is entertaining and hilarious but certain things are just too far you have no idea what Ive had to go through 
Im a human being Im an artist, bro
you probably got bootleg Yeezys on right now
but Media Takeout couldnt say one thing positive knowing damn well youd love to be on the YEEZY 350 list
people were crying people were throwing up the fist people were dancing
I had an album listening and clothing presentation and Madison Square Garden
respect the struggle respect the hustle respect the dreams  respect the movement
You seem like the type of organization hired to always keep dreamers down when certain things in history happen you just got to respect it
Now - Media Takeout - always remember that you dissed the collection that changed the world.
Its Chance's fault the album not out yet he really wanted Waves on that Bitch  we in the lab now...
There would be no MSG without @iamdiddy my OG. He fought this war 15 years ago. Respect OG.

I want to be the creative director of Hermes
not just the famous people there    but the kids   the moms the dads  the families that came to share this moment with us
9th   It felt like a seen from The Warriors     ALL GODS   ALL GODS ALL GODS in the buildin
but you can see at Madison Square Garden that you can stop us
8th   They want to control us with money and perception and mute the culture
7th  I miss that feeling  so thats what I want to help restore
Thats why music is so fucking watered down right now    I miss that DMX feeling
6th  Stop trying to demonize real artist     Stop trying to compromise art
I cant be mad at Kanye because he made me famous!  #FACTS
She was having dinner with one of our friends whos name I will keep out of this and she told him
5th  thing Im not even gone take credit for the idea its actually something Taylor came up with 
4th Bitch is an endearing term in hip hop  like the word Nigga
3rd thing    I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings
2nd thing   I asked my wife  for her blessings and she was cool with it
First thing is Im an artist and as an artist I will express how I feel with no censorship
First thing is Im an artist and as an artist I will express how I feel with no censorship

Seems like just yesterday we were interning at Fendi - now youre nominated for the LVMH Young Designer Prize.
I am so proud of my family Virgil Abloh.
If you wanna have a drink with me, book a table at the spotted pig when Im back in NY.
We want to innovate and we will win someday.
All we have are our dreams, and you can step on our dreams and ideas all you want, but we wont stop fighting.
Fame is often looked down upon in the design world, so its actually been something I had to overcome.
because I was too famous by the time I realized I wanted to design.
I dont call myself a designer as I was not allowed to go to Saint Martins
I have millions of ideas and I represent a new generation just trying to express themselves in a broken world.
and I have encountered countless amounts of bigotry along the way.
To Fern Mallis: I just want you to understand that attempting to do clothing has been very difficult

The doors may be heavier, but I promise you WE WILL BREAK THEM.
Ten years later I am still the same kid from Chicago, still dreaming out loud, still banging on the door.
I wake up every day trying to give something back to you that you can rock to and be proud of.
I am honored and humbled by my fans, for the unwavering support and love over the past ten years.
gave of their heart to that project, and to all the projects that followed, and are to come.
I am extremely grateful to each and every person along that road who helped, lent an ear, lent their voice,
to not only convince my peers and the public that I could be an artist, but to actually get that art out for the world to hear.
I say "finally" because it was a long road, a constant struggle, and a true labor of love
Ten years ago today we finally released what had been my life's work up to that point: The College Dropout.

Thank you, Mandela, for your life's work and may it serve as a guiding light to illuminate our future.
At a young age my mother taught me the importance of his work. Mandela sacrificed his life for the betterment of mankind.
I'd like to address the false stories and noise that have been engineered by the media.
Despite recent media reports, I've never said anything to dishonor or trivialize the life or transition of one of the most inspiring leaders
Respect to Mandela, his family and his legacy.
