What in da fuck was dat Kanye?I told you to do some shit for da kids.
You give me your muthafucking graduation ticket right now.
You can give me this muthafuckin robe
You will not walk across that stage, you won't slide across that stage
A muthafucka can't pull you across that mothafuckin stage Kanye
Who told you see, I told you to do something up lifting
I'm trynna get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me
You know what us a nigga
And I don't mean that in no nice way
Had little kids singin about the shit, the jokes on you
You can throw your muthafuckin hands in the air, and wave good-bye to every-mothafuckin-body
Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus
Motha what you gone do now

I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody.
I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody.
I got something better than school but don't tell anybody.
My momma would kill me so don't tell anybody.
She wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody.
She ain't walked in my shoes, I'm just not everybody.[Chorus:]
I always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
Wow, one day, they tried to bring me down
ALways knew that one day, they would try to bring me down
Down, way down

[Kanye]
We gon' to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you evern wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin, that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some lee way on the he say she say
You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say No able ingle
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't hurt myself
Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself
And I'm a look in the mirror if I need some help
Ask me from the heart, y'all all frontin
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel somethin

Why you come here, I bet it only it was forget to get you
What kind of dream we found, see I'm often at your cross way
forgetting it was that heaven let you. They tried to bring me down

[Chorus : 5X]Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

[Kanye West]
She don?t believe in shootin' stars,
but she believe in shoes & cars
Wood floors in the new apartment,
couture from the store?s department
You more like "I love to start shit",
I?m more of the, trips to florida
Order the hors d'oeuvre, views of the Water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy,
man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy,
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a ?Oeur de Whopdee?
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggaz got me,
I hate these niggaz more than the Nazis

[Dwele]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

[Kanye West]
I know it?s been a while,
Sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay,
a-bay late-ly you been all on my brain,
And if somebody would?ve told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn?t wanna know
If somebody would?ve told me a year ago
it'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory?s museum,
I?m just saying, Hey Mona Lisa,
come home you know you can?t Rome without Caesar

[Dwele]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights

Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

[Fade out]
Lights, lights, lights, lights?It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

[Chorus]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x2]
It's amazing

I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved

[Chorus]
And no matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x2]
It's amazing

I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave in, never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

[Chorus]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x4]
It's amazing

[Young Jeezy]
I'm amazing (amazing), yeah I'm all that (all that)
If I ain't on my grind than what you call that (what you call that)
Victorious, yeah we warriors
We make history, strive for victory (yeah)
Standing at my podium, I'm trying to watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure either let the feds catch ya (yeah)
I'm amazing born on a full moon
I was breed to get it in, no spoon
That's why I'm so goon summer time no joke
Big family small house, no room
They like "Oh God, why he go so hard
Look what he's been through, he deserves an applause"

[Outro]
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x4]
It's amazing

My big brother was BIG's brother,
Used to Be Dame and BIG's brother,
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend,
No I.D my mentor, Now Let the story begin.

[VERSE 1]
It's the hard knock life tour, sell out,
Picture us in the mall coppin' iceberg and yell out jigga (jigga),
Yeah that's what we'll yell out (yell out),
You know the name do, i gotta spell out, or tell bout?

J.A.Y, and Ye' so shy, now he won't even step to his idol to say hi.
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by,
Back of my mind, he could change your life.
With all these beats i did, atleast let him hear,
Atleast you can brag to your friends back at the gig.

But he got me out my mama' crib,
Then he helped me get my mama' a crib.

[CHORUS]
Big brother was BIG's brother,
Used to Be Dame and BIG's brother,
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend,
No I.D my mentor, Now Let the story begin (begin).

Let the story begin (let the story begin).
If you feel the way i feel, why don't you wave your hands?

[VERSE 2]
Fresh off the plane, im off the base line.
Nothin' handed out, im bout to take mine.
Round the same time of that Blueprint One,
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for im'.
I played my little songs in that old back room,
He'd bop his head and say, 'damn, oh thats you?'
But by the black album, i was blackin' out,
Party at S.O.B's and we had packed the crowd.

Big brother got a show up in Madison Square,
And i'm like, 'Yeah yeah, we gon' be there!'
But, not only did i not get a chance to spit it.
Carlene told me i could buy two tickets.

I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different,
And kept little brother at bay at a distance.
But everything that i felt was more bogus,
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent.

Only thing i wanna know, is why i get looked over,
I guess i understand when i get more older.
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem,
Now im' on the top and everybody on the Scrotum.

[CHORUS]
My Big brother was B.I.G's brother,
Used to Be Dame and B.I.G's brother,
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend,
No I.D my mentor, now Let the story begin (begin).

Let the story begin.
If you feel the way i feel, why won't you wave your hands?

[VERSE 3]
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, but the presedito.
Hola' Hovito', the game gettin' foul, so here's a free throw.
I was always on the other side of the people,
Then i dropped Jesus Walks, now im on a steeple.
And we know, New Jack City gotta keep my brother,
But to be number one, imma' beat my brother.

On that diamonds remix, i swore i'd spaz,
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass!
Sibling rivalry, only i could see, it was the pride in me, that was drivin' me.
At the grammy's i said, i inspired me.
But my big brother who i always tried to be.
When i kicked the flow, it was like pick and roll',
Coz even if he gave me the ROC, it's give and go.

I guess Beanie styled was more of a slam dunk,
And my shit was more like a finger roll, but i had them singles so,
And them hoe's at the show gonna' mingle yo, (laughs), ya'll know!

I told Jay i did a song with Coldplay,
Next thing i know, he got a song with Coldplay.
Back of my mind, im like 'damn,no way',
Translate Espanyol, No way Jose'!
Then i went and told Jay Brown,
Should have known that was gonna come back around,
Should have talked to you like a man, should have told you first,
But i told someone else and thats what made shit worse.

My big brother, was BIG's brother,
So here's a few words from ya kid brother.
If you admire somebody, you should go head and tell em',
People never get the flowers, while they can still smell em'.

A idol in my eyes, god of the game, heart of the city, Roc-a-fella Chain,
Never be the same, never be another number one Young Hov' or so my big brother.

[CHORUS]
My Big brother was B.I.G's brother,

How we stop the black panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that?
What Gil Scott was hearin
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin.
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland
We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynch
And we been hangin from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it,sell it
The fiends cop it
Nowadays they cant tell if that's that good shit
We ain't sure man
Put the CD on your toungue yeah, thats pure man.

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
From the place where the fathers gone,
The mothers is hardly home

How the Mexicans say we just tryin to party homes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical,
Arm and Hammer baking soda
Raised they own quota
Writin when our soldiers ran for the stove cuz--
Cuz dreams of being 'Hova went from bein a brokeman ta bein a dopeman
Ta bein a president look theres hope man
This that inspiration for tha mos and tha folks man,
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosin.

Our father, give us this day our daily bread ...give us these days and take our daily bread,
See I done did all this ole bullshit
And to attone I throw a little somethin, somethin on the pulpit.
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mammas aint got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from grammy
Now the former slaves trade hooks for grammies
This dark dixon has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use it.Time is wandering fast over the hills and alleys
Time is wandering fast over the streets and valleys
Time is wandering fast I wonder how far is will go
Time is wandering fast children are running to gather her
Time is wandering fast all of the seasons are passing her
Time is wandering fast I wonder how far is will go
TIme is wandering fastI had a dream I can buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace.
I told God I'd be back in a second,
Man It's so hard not to act reckless.
To whom much is given much is tested.
Get arrested, guess until, they get the message.
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny,
and what I do? act more stupidly.
bought more jewelry, more louis v, my mama couldn't get through to me.
The drama, people suing me,
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me.
I'm just saying how I feel man,
I ain't one of the Cosby?s I ain?t go to Hill man
I guess the money should've changed him,
I guess I should've forgot where I came From.

[Chorus:]
La, la, la, la wait till I get my money right
la, la, la, la then you cant tell me nothing right
Excuse Me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let up the suicide doors.
This is my life homey, you decide yours.
I know that Jesus died for us,
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars.
So I parallel double parked that muthafucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homey this is my day.
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
You know I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it.

They say I talk with so much emphasis,
They're so sensative.
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
Say something were you gone end up apologing.
Let me know if it's a problem man,
Alright man, holla then.

Chorus:
La, la, la, la wait till I get my money right
la, la, la, la then you can't tell me nothing right
Excuse Me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash,
Let that man get past.
You don't need a stop to get gas,
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off the fumes cuzz
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul,
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold.
Treasure. What's you pleasure?
Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her.
So if the devil wear Prada,
Adam Eve wear Nada,
I'm in between, but way more fresher.
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard,
That's when you die hard.
Ya homies looking like "Why God?"
When they reminisce over you, my god.

Chorus:
La, la, la, la wait till I get my money right
la, la, la, la then you cant tell me nothing right
Excuse Me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing.''Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin' show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
That's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

''Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But everytime I want it, layaway or a deposit
My daddy say "when you see clothes close your eyelids"
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'll get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he sent me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey!

''Did you realize

I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the drop out keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle

Like I dropped out of P.E.
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

Never Again[Intro]
You just popped in the Kanye West
Get right for the summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
you might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude wit' a car
So first of all we gon' work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass!

[Verse 1]
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came..
I came...
I came..

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
then maybe we can work it out
Work it out (Come on) [4x]
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)

[Verse 2]
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista said get it wet
Ooh girl your breath is HARSH
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still killa a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweatin' to the oldies we jukin to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone

But I still mess with a big girl if you ain't fit girl I'll hit girl
1 and you brought 2 friends OK 3 more now hop in the Benz
Four door do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8
All the mocha lattes you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us, ballas

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about

They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

[Chorus]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
he write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If you're a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

[Chorus]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more could you ask for?
The international assholes nah
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&amp;amp;R's lookin' like &amp;quot;pssh we messed up&amp;quot;
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog &amp;quot;Yo, where Dame at?&amp;quot;
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
&amp;quot;What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?&amp;quot;
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)Oh oh ohoo.
damn, here we go again.
Oh oh ohoo.
Common passed on this beat, i made it to a jam,

now everything im not, made me everything i am.
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything im not, made me everything i am.

I never be picture-perfect-[[Beyonc?]]
Be light as Al B. or black as Chauncey
Remember him from [[Blackstreet]]
He was as black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as his beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
Y'see how I creeped up?
Y'see how I played a big role in Chicago like [[Queen Latifah]]?
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like [[will.i.am]]
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
but everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

and i'm back to tear it up
haters, start your engines
I hear 'em gearin' up
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops
they forget to get they haircut
okay fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
so say goodbye to the NAACP award
goodbye to the In-di-a Arie award
they'd rather give me the ni-nigga-please award
but I'll just take the I-got-alotta-cheese award

damn, here we go again.
but everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

I know people wouldn't usually rap this
but I got the facts to back this
just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
man, killin's some wack shit
oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
he got changed over his chains, a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
the church want tithes, so I can't afford to pay
the slip on my door, cause I can't afford to stay
my 15 seconds' up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today

damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
but everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I amFlashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

[Kanye West]
She don?t believe in shootin' stars,
but she believe in shoes & cars
Wood floors in the new apartment,
couture from the store?s department
You more like "I love to start shit",
I?m more of the, trips to florida
Order the hors d'oeuvre, views of the Water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy,
man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy,
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a ?Oeur de Whopdee?
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggaz got me,
I hate these niggaz more than the Nazis

[Dwele]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

[Kanye West]
I know it?s been a while,
Sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay,
a-bay late-ly you been all on my brain,
And if somebody would?ve told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn?t wanna know
If somebody would?ve told me a year ago
it'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory?s museum,
I?m just saying, Hey Mona Lisa,
come home you know you can?t Rome without Caesar

[Dwele]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights

Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

[Fade out]
Lights, lights, lights, lights?[Jamie Foxx]
She take my money when I'm in need
Yea she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh she's a gold digga way over town
That dig's on me.

[Chorus:]
She gives me money
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
When I'm Need
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggas
She gives me money
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
When I'm need
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggas
I gotta leave
Get down girl gone head get down
I gotta leave
Get down girl gone head get down
I gotta leave
Get down girl gone head get down
I gotta leave
Get down girl gone head

[Verse 1:]
Cutie the bomb met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you rock I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock I can tell by your charm
and your arm but I'm lookin for the one have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
An I gotta take all they bad ass to show-biz
Ok, get your kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to Den and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be payed
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she use to fuck wit Usher
I dont care what none of yall say, I still love her

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
18 years, 18 years
She got one of yo kids got you for 18 years
I know somebody payin child support for one of his kids
His baby momma car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was s'pose to buy you shorty TYCO with your money
She went to the doctor got lypo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should of got that insured GEICO for your money
If you aint no punk
holla 'We Want Prenup' 'WE WANT PRENUP! Yeaah!'
It's something that you need to have
Cause when she leave your ass she gone leave with half
18 years, 18 years
And on her 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Now I ain't sayin you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You got out to eat and he can't pay, ya'll cant leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But why ya'll washin' watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look in his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know his dude's ballin, but yeah thats nice
And they gone keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right girl
And when you get on, he leave your ass for a white girl

Get down girl gone head get down
Get down girl gone head get down
get down girl gone head get down
get down girl gone head.But it's too late, it's too late
He, gone

[Kanye West]
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
BROTHER NUMPSAY! Groupies sound too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way

[Chorus]
Too late, we, gone - we strivin home
Gone - we ride on chrome
It's too late

[Kanye West]
Y'all don't want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the win-turr
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught somethin on the Usher tour he had to &quot;Let it Burn&quot;
Plus he already got three chil'run
Arguin over babysitters like, &quot;Bitch - it's yo' turn!&quot;
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to bitch you
Even your superficial raps is super official
R-R-R-Roc pastel with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long
Cause the dookie's on any song that they threw me on, gone

[Chorus]
We strivin home, gone
[Cam] I ride on chrome...
We strivin home, gone
[Cam] Killa, I ride on chrome

[Cam'Ron]
Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, gorilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal ma we goin to the {?}
No concealin, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof, be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag, niggas still doin puff puff pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched up Jag, shit
Y'all niggas want Killa Cam, cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell 'em (too late, he, gone)
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm (gone)
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say (too late, he, gone)
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy actin like a thief in disguise
Ain't leavin my side, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi, shit
And that ain't leavin alive, please believe me
Gave Weezy a piece of the pie, and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole Westside I explore with the Beemer now

[Chorus]
We strivin home, I ride on chrome
Listen homeboy move on
That's your best bet, why's that?
Cause

[Consequence]
Uhh, uhh, yo, yo
I been pourin out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And tryin to help his momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got a foul on, what coulda gone wrong
Now they askin Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money mighta gone to my head
Cause they got me thinkin money mighta gone to the feds
So I ain't goin to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed
And when I came the next mornin he was gone with my bread
And with that bein said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But lookin back now shoulda gone to the crib
And rented &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; cause I'da gone about 10
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is tellin me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for 20 years, doin time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some cruddy crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone

[long instrumental pause]

[Kanye West imitating "The Show" at first]
Uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh I'mmmm
Ah-head of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my Aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leavin it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime-
-light, like, when I was on the grind
In the "One, Nine, Nine, Nine"
Before, model chicks was bendin over or
Dealerships asked me Benz or Rover, man
If I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an 18-year-old
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro
My dawg worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural-fied
A week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirrow
How we out in Europe, spendin Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's GONE
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MC's
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything includin the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin, stay calm
Shorty's at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said sorry Mr. West is gone!Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

I'm a get on this TV mama, I'm a...

It feel like VA, or the Bay, or Ye
Ayy, this is the good life
Welcome to the good life

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While getting' some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen snakes on a plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get izz
Having money's the everything that having' it is
I was splurging' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas cause
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life

Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmama ain't the only girl calling me baby
And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh

Whooooooooooo, what up derrty?
Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl fine
Yo, yo, Kanye, yo turn it up, a little bit, whoo

[Hook]
Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..

[Kanye West {*over the hook*}]
Yo, this is a Roc-a-Fella, St. Lunatics collaboration
Chi-Town and St. Louis
She said she ain't never seen Murphy Lee befo'

[Murphy Lee]
I called her back from an earlier beep
Fo' in the mornin' they be like &quot;Nah, I wasn't sleep&quot;
Convenient whore stay on top of convenient stores
Keep pictures of me in their Victoria Secret drawer
I keep somethin' hot on tour
Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in store
See I adore the ones that call me Tory, true story
I created 'hood rats so these new mice bore me
See I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait
Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates
So know I got elevens and twelves
With at least thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell
Hehehehehehehehe hell, I remember when she smashed LaBelle
See most women kinda sneaky like a six-year old
Hey yo they always in the summer, somethin' wrong with their nails

[Hook]
Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..

[Kanye West]
What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead
That you know don't like you?
She'll run over your head with a motorcycle
I mean the way you look is nice, but there's more to life boo
Cuz I could go to videos and get fo' just lik[Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say
nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
From the Chi, Like Tim, it's a Hardaway
till this is in the name of love, like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today,
can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer aids,
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Abu Akhbar be throwin' some hot cause
things we seein' on the screen not ours
but these niggas from the hood, so these dreams not far
where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
but they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it, uh
Chorus:
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll find a way
[Adam Levine]
And nothin' lasts forever, but be honest baby
It hurts, but it may be the only way
[Kanye West]
They say people in your life for seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun-clappin' and keep to squeezin'
And gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'
In Jesus, and one day that she'll see him
Till then in walk his footsteps and try to be him,
The devil is alive, I feel him breathin'
Claimin' money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down,
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, sick of it now,
Chorus:
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll find a way
[Adam Levine]
And nothin' lasts forever, but be honest baby
It hurts, but it may be the only way
[Adam Levine]
With every worthless word we get more far away
And nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And nothin lasts forever, but be honest, baby
It hurts, but it may be the only way.In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless... oh
How could you be so heartless?

How could you be so,
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
And yo I know of some things that you ain't told me
And yo I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back
And you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend
Well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless... oh
How could you be so heartless?


How could you be so Dr. Evil
You're bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak so why we up 3 a.m. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me for, homie I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up cause I already know how this thing goes,
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see,
You'll never find nobody better than me

In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless... oh
How could you be so heartless?


Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk,
Baby lets just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
and you can't make it right
Im gon' take off tonight
In to the night...

In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless... oh
How could you be so heartless? *2 timesLike we always do at this time
I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good

Welcome to the good life
Where niggas that sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V

Shit they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi
Now throw your hands up in the sky
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry
Yo it's got to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine

Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
Cause they got more
Ass than the models
The good life, so keep it coming' with the bottles
Till she feel boozed like she bombed out Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C.
It feel like VA, or the Bay, or Ye
Ayy, this is the good life
Welcome to the good life

Homie, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood
Like I'm new in the hood, the only thing I wish?
I wish a nigga would
He probably think he could, but, but
I don't think he should
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine

I'm a get on this TV mama, I'm a...

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While getting' some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen snakes on a plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get izz
Having money's the everything that having' it is
I was splurging' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas cause
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life

Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmama ain't the only girl calling me baby
And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh
I'm good.Artist: Kanye West
Album: Late Registration
Song: Hey Mama
Typed by: ricorendezvous@hotmail.com

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cuz I?m so proud of you
Let me tell you what I?m about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I?m goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I?m finna let it shine
I?m finna take yall back to them better times
I?m finna talk about my mama if yall don?t mind
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn?t give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy cant you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy Imma love you till you don?t hurt no more
And when I?m older, you aint gotta work no more
And Imma get you that mansion that we couldn?t afford
See you?re, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that?s makin loot
A livin legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it?s things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of ?You, Are So Beautiful To Me??
Can?t you see, you?re like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nicky Giovanni, turn one page and there?s my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, yall say Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I guess it also depends tho, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)

[Verse 3]
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
Imma get you a jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don?t gotta be Mother?s Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say (Hey Mama)

[Chorus] (with variations)And you say Chi-City?
Chi-City, Chi-City

Im coming home again
Do you think about me now and then? Yea
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again, coming home again


I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I love most, she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me little homie, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Wendy [windy], and
I like to blow trees" and
From that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tell 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she show me how to go downtown
And in the nighttime, her face lit up, so astound
And I told her, in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV, and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me"

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again, coming home again

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Ohh
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we could start again.

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport, to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you, and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do, just not new"
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'till it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that, when I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jumpin' a crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-town
(I'm coming home again)

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again, coming home again

Baby, do you remember when fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again, coming home again
Baby, do you remember when fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again, maybe we can start again.Oh oh ohoo.
damn, here we go again.
Oh oh ohoo.
Common passed on this beat, i made it to a jam,

now everything im not, made me everything i am.
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything im not, made me everything i am.

I never be picture-perfect-[[Beyonc?]]
Be light as Al B. or black as Chauncey
Remember him from [[Blackstreet]]
He was as black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as his beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
Y'see how I creeped up?
Y'see how I played a big role in Chicago like [[Queen Latifah]]?
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like [[will.i.am]]
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
but everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

and i'm back to tear it up
haters, start your engines
I hear 'em gearin' up
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops
they forget to get they haircut
okay fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
so say goodbye to the NAACP award
goodbye to the In-di-a Arie award
they'd rather give me the ni-nigga-please award
but I'll just take the I-got-alotta-cheese award

damn, here we go again.
but everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

I know people wouldn't usually rap this
but I got the facts to back this
just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
man, killin's some wack shit
oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
he got changed over his chains, a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
the church want tithes, so I can't afford to pay
the slip on my door, cause I can't afford to stay
my 15 seconds' up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today

damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
but everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I amFind your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

You say he get on your fuckin' nerves
you hope that he get what he deserves, word
do you even remember what the issue is
you just trying to find where the tissue is
you can still be who you wish you is
it ain't happen yet
and that's what the intuition is
when you hop back in the car
drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
the smokescreens
the chokes and the screams
you ever wonder what it all really mean

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

and I'm back on my grind
a psychic read my lifeline
told me in my lifetime
my name would help light up the Chicago skyline
and that's why I'm
7:00, that's primetime
heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
why he keep giving me hot lines
I'm a star, how could I not shine
how many ladies in the house
how many ladies in the house without a spouse
something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
what you about
on that independent shit
trade it all for a husband and some kids
you ever wonder what it all really mean
you wonder if you'll ever find your dreams.I need to recruit all the soldiers
All of God's soldiers
We at war...
We at war with society, racism, terrorism
But most of all...we at war with ourselves

(Jesus walks)
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walks with me, with me, with me, with me, with me)

You know what the mid-west is?
Young and Restless
Where restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (niggas) who Kanye West is. HUH!

I walk through the valley where the shadow of death is.
Top floor of the view alone will leave you breathless
Try to catch it ... it's kind of hard
Getting choked by detectives yeah yeah now check the method.
They be asking us questions, harass and arrest us
Saying We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit what's the basis?
We ain't going no where but got suits and cases.
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis.
My momma used to say only Jesus can save us.
Well momma I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone til November. I got packs to move I hope.

Chorus (2x)
(Jesus walks)
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now.
(Jesus walks)
And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong
(Jesus walks with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)

To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers...
(Jesus walks with them!)
To the victims of welfare feel we living in hell here, hell yea...
(Jesus walks with them!)
Now hear ye hear ye wanna see thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheist into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathy Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dawg radio needs this
They said you can rap anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk bout God my record won't get played
Huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope it take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin 'bout
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out...

(Jesus walks)
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now.
(Jesus walks)
And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong
(Jesus walks with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never, never know
Never know enough, til it's over love
Til we lose control, system overload
Screamin no, no, no, no, no
I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
You keep ya love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin' to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, In the danger zone
How many times did I take fo' it finally got through
you lose, you lose
I'm aint lovin you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life
which is wastin' time, where's the finish line

So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
You keep ya love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to
I met no one new, I got no one new
I know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin, keep the lovin gone
Keep it on a roll, only god knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
When i wanna go, I dont need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to

So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, you lose, you lose, you lose Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

[Kanye West]
She don?t believe in shootin' stars,
but she believe in shoes & cars
Wood floors in the new apartment,
couture from the store?s department
You more like "I love to start shit",
I?m more of the, trips to florida
Order the hors d'oeuvre, views of the Water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy,
man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy,
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a ?Oeur de Whopdee?
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggaz got me,
I hate these niggaz more than the Nazis

[Dwele]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

[Kanye West]
I know it?s been a while,
Sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay,
a-bay late-ly you been all on my brain,
And if somebody would?ve told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn?t wanna know
If somebody would?ve told me a year ago
it'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory?s museum,
I?m just saying, Hey Mona Lisa,
come home you know you can?t Rome without Caesar

[Dwele]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights

Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

Lights, lights, lights, lights?[Intro]

Man, at least a dude wit' a car
So first of all we gon' work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass!

[Verse 1]
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came..
I came...

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me

[Verse 2]
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette

Hustlers, gangstas, all us, ballas

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but

Why are you so paranoid?
Don't be so paranoid.
Don't be so

Baby don't worry bout it
Hey there don't even think about it
You worry bout the wrong things
The wrong things[x4]


(Verse 1)
Tell me right now you really wanna spend your whole life alone?
A little time out might do you good, might do us good.
'Fore we be done for good.
Cuz i can make it good i can make it hood
I can make you come i can make you go
I can make it high i can make it fly
Make you touch the sky
Hey maybe so.

All the time you be up in my
Checking through my cellphone
Baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night?
Here's another fight
Oh here we go


(Chorus)
Baby don't worry bout it
Lady we'll go out to the floor

[Kid cudi]
Anyway they don't know you like I do (They don't know)
They'll never know you (Never Know)
Anyway they don't know you like I do (Never Know)


(Verse 2)
All of the time you wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me
Show some gratitude
Leave the attitude way back at home
Yeah you see em look
Baby let em look
Give you cold looks cuz we look cold
Yeah you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world lost in the world
'Til you finally let that thing go
You wanna check into the heartbreak hotel
But sorry we're closed.


(Chorus)
Lady don't worry bout it
Baby we'll go out to the floor

[Kid cudi]
Anyway they don't know you like I do (to they floor)
They'll never know you (Hey! never know)
Anyway they don't know you like I do (They don't know)


(Outro)
Baby don't worry bout it
Lady don't even think about
You worry bout the wrong things
The wrong things[x3]
You worry bout the wrong thing

[Kid cudi]
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway they don't know you like I do[x2]
They'll never know you.I'm living in the 21st century doin' something mean to it
Do it better then anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

[Chorus:]
No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the power
(21st century Schizoid Man)

The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose motherfucker we rollin',
Huh? motherfucker we rollin'
With some light skinned girls and some Kelly Rowland's
In this white man's world we the ones chosen
So goodnight cruel world I'll see you in the mornin',
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment.

[Chorus:]
No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the power
Till then, fuck that the world's ours
(21st Century Schizoid Man)

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my ass hole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes!
You short minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My child-like creativity, purity and honesty is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me, taking my inner child I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrust in me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece thinking...

[Chorus:]
No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the powder
Till then, fuck that the world's ours
(21st Century Schizoid Man)

Colin Powell, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well that's a pretty bad way to start a conversation
At the end of the day goddamn it I'm killin' this shit
I know damn well ya'll feelin' this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick
I ain't got a power trip who you going home with?
How 'Ye doin'? I'm Surviving
I was drinkin' earlier now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches huh? Where ya hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'...

(Oh hey Oh hey Oh hey
Hey Hey)

Now this'll be a beautiful death
[Dwele:]
I'm jumping out the window
I'm Letting everything go
I'm Letting everything go
[x3]

You got the power to let power go flow
[Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say
nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
From the Chi, Like Tim, it's a Hardaway
till this is in the name of love, like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today,
can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer aids,
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Abu Akhbar be throwin' some hot cause
things we seein' on the screen not ours
but these niggas from the hood, so these dreams not far
where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
but they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it, uh
Chorus:
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll find a way
[Adam Levine]
And nothin' lasts forever, but be honest baby
It hurts, but it may be the only way
[Kanye West]
They say people in your life for seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun-clappin' and keep to squeezin'
And gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'
In Jesus, and one day that she'll see him
Till then in walk his footsteps and try to be him,
The devil is alive, I feel him breathin'
Claimin' money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down,
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, sick of it now,
Chorus:
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll find a way
[Adam Levine]
And nothin' lasts forever, but be honest baby
It hurts, but it may be the only way
[Adam Levine]
With every worthless word we get more far away
And nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And nothin lasts forever, but be honest, baby
It hurts, but it may be the only way.singly Roads would never change your mind

Makes us harder, better, faster, stronger!'' [played throughout]

''Work it harder make it better,

More than ever, hour after hour,
Work is never over'' [played throughout]

Now that don't kill me,
Can only make me stronger.
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer.
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger.
Man, I been waitin' all night now,
That's how long I've been on ya.

I need you right now,
I need you right now.

Let's get lost tonight,
You can be my black Kate Moss tonight.
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight,
And you don't give a fuck what they all say right
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior,
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore,
I ask 'cause I'm not sure,
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'Cause right now thou hast forsaken us.
You should be honored by my lateness,
That I would even show up to this fake shit.
So go ahead, go nuts, go ape shit,
Especially in my pastel, on my bape shit,
Act like you can't tell who made this,
New gospel, homey, take six, and take this, haters.

Now that don't kill me,
Can only make me stronger.
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer.
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger.
Man, I been waitin' all night now,
That's how long I've been on ya.

I need you right now,
I need you right now.

Me like it.

I don't know if you got a man or not,
If you made plans or not,
If God put me in your plans or not,
I'm trippin', this drink got me sayin' a lot.
But I know that God put you in front of me,
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me.
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment, right
'Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night,
So we gon' do everything that Kan like,
Heard they do anything for a Klondike,
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke.
And she'll do anything for the limelight,
And we'll do anything when the time's right,
Uh, baby, you're makin' it
Harder, better, faster, stronger,

Now that don't kill me,
Can only make me stronger, ''oh!''
I need you to hurry up now, ''oh!''
'Cause I can't wait much longer, ''oh!''
I know I got to be right now, ''oh!''
'Cause I can't get much wronger, ''oh!''

That's how long I've been on ya.

I need you right now,

Since OJ had Isotoners,
Don't act like I never told ya.
Don't act like I never told ya.
Don't act like I never told ya.
Don't act like I never told ya.
Don't act like I never told ya.

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can that huh?
I spit it through the wire man
To much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kayne titter....
Chi-Town what's going on man

(Verse 1)
I drink a boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizerk
Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back wizzork
How do you console my mom or give her light support
When you telling her your sons' on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmit Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing them dynasty signs
I'm use to trying to reline
I been trying to be sign
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the making man

(In background)
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I really apologize how I sound right now man
This ain't fair at all man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru....
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth
I couldn't believe it
But im still here for yall right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah

(Verse 2)
What if somebody from the Chi-town was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't to cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep my safe book safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
it was televised
There`s been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

(In background)
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Know what im saying
When the doctor told me I had a um.. I was goin to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
Its bad I got all this jewelry on
Can't be serious man[Chorus 1]
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'm a touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'm a touch the sky

Back when they thought pink polos would hurt the Roc,
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox.
Now let's go.
Take 'em back to the plan...
Me and my mama hopped in the U-Haul van.
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them,
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.
Let's take 'em back to the club.
Least about an hour I would stand on line,
I just wanted to dance.
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.
I just wanted to shine.
Jay's favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"
A hip hop legend,
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.

[Chorus]

[Hook 1]
Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world
Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock,
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop,
I would do anything to say "I got it,"
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket.
Before anybody wanted K-West beats,
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC.
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns,
Like "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an aeroplane,
And I don't know if I'll be back again.
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets,
But when she came to kick it, things became different.
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on.
I couldn't keep it home, I thought I needed a Nia Long.
I'm trying to write my wrongs,
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song.
Now,

[Chorus 2]
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, You gonna touch the sky
You gonna touch the sky baby girl!
Testify, come up in the spot
Looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, You gonna touch the sky

Yes, yes, yes guess who's on third?
Lupe still like Lupin the Third.
Hear life here till I'm coke on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but been on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth's.
But, before you say another word,
I'm back on the block like a man on the street.
I'm trying to stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra,
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.
Engarde, Touch Lupe cool as the Unthar,
But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.
I come as correct as a porn star,
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.
So, I represent the first.
Now, let me hear my verse right where the horns are like

[Chorus 2]

[Hook 2]
We back at home, baby
Sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
Sky, Sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
Yeah!
Keep it rollin'
Feels good to be home, baby! Feels good to be home!My friend showed me pictures of his kids,
And all I could show him were pictures of my cribs.
He said his daughter got a brand-new report card,
And all I got was a brand-new sportscar.

And my head keeps spinning,
Can't stop having these visions,
I gotta keep winnin'.
2x

Dad cracked a joke, all the kids laughed,
But I couldn't hear him all the way in first-class.
Chased the good-life, my whole life long,
Look back on my life, and my life gone,
Where did I go wrong?

And my head keeps spinning,
Can't stop having these visions,
I gotta keep winnin'.
2x

I've seen it, I've seen it before.
I've seen it, I've seen it before.
I've seen it, I've seen it before.
I've seen it, I've seen it before.

My god sister's gettin' married by the lake,
But I couldn't figure out who I'd wanna take.
Bad enough that I showed up late,
I had to leave before they even cut the cake.
Welcome to heartbreak.

And my head keeps spinning,
Can't stop having these visions,
I gotta keep winnin'.
2x
And I can- and I can't stop.
No, no, I can't stop.
No, no, no, no I can't stop.
No, no, no, no I can't stop.

I can't stop.
Can't stop.
Can't stop.

No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no.
I can't stop.

?spinning,
Can't stop having these visions,
I gotta keep winnin'.
