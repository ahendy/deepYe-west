Royre doesn't make a Polar bear bed but the Polar bear couch is my favorite piece of furniture we own https://t.co/tSJgikAUmTand also my number one design rule of anything I do from shoes to music to homes is that Kim has to like it....
plus when you sit on the platform your calf is sort of half on half off
I love Rick Owens bed design but the back is too high for the beams and angle of the ceilingI've been trying to figure out the bed design for the master bedroom at our Hidden Hills compound... https://t.co/aEPqoBGY4b

I  used to love Kanye
I used to love Kanye
And now I look and look around and theres so many KanyesIt wasnt any KanyesSee I invented Kanye
I gotta say at that time Id like to meet KanyeChop up the beats Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye
Spaz in the news Kanye
The always rude Kanye

I used an exclamation just to be an asshole and also to make a point! LOL
And I used a period because contrary to popular belief I strongly dislike exclamation points!
On another note, I strongly dislike suit jackets. I used the word dislike because I hate the word hate.
I love you.
I have so much love in my heart and we just need the shot to create live breathe.
I love you guys.
Everyone has made mistakes. I just make them in public.
Don't hide from the truth because it is the only light.
Don't be mad at the truth. When you don't like me you are merely shooting the messenger.
Don't be scared of the truth because we need to restart the human foundation in truth
They think we're stupid. They do not know how to communicate.
When companies doubt me they doubt us.
That dreams will actualize. Dreams will manifest.
I have a dream.
Eventually the guys with real ideas not running a scam on the world will overcome.
They can't kill us all.
I speak yell scream directly at the old guard on behalf of the future.
The Pablo pop up was almost a pop up of influence.
We are here to make life better.
And I promise the power is in the people and I will use the power given by the people to bring everything I have back to the people.
I speak truth to power!!!
I represent the dreamers.
in the past the press/old guard and powers that be would have silenced me a long time ago but I have a form of social immunity.
thank God for paps thank God for social media
We will find freedom in truth as opposed to ridicule.
We no longer have to be scared of the truth
We will breathe clean air and exercise the first amendment.
We will not get bullied by perception any longer. We will give our opinions.
We will change that. We will rise.  We will have a voice.
In Roman times the artist would contemplate proportions and colors. Now there is only one important color... Green
Let's fight for our future. We can change everything.
I stand with the utmost humility. We are so blessed!!! All praises and blessings to the families of people who never gave up on dreams
I promise I will never let the people down. I want a better life for all!!! Pablo Pablo Pablo Pablo!
This is the people the culture the dreams the future.
but there is no other brand that could sell 1 million dollars of clothing in 2 days from 1 location!!!
they called me crazy and pointed fingers
Pablo in blood.
every red print is our blood our debt our shame our struggle our pain our heart ache.
Pablo in blood
